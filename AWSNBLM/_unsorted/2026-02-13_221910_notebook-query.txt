Based on the **Session 028** records and the **v1.3 Wishlist** documentation, here are the latest changes and the current maintenance protocols.

### Latest Changes (Session 028)

Session 028 (2026-02-13) focused primarily on **Documentation** and **Indexer** updates, specifically correcting a corruption issue with the development wishlist and establishing new architectural workflows [1].

*   **Wishlist Restoration & Upgrade:** The wishlist had been corrupted in Session 027 (compressed to placeholders); it was successfully recovered using `git show` via SSH and rebuilt as **v1.3** [2].
*   **New Wishlist Items Added:**
    *   **W-064 (Chronicler Git History Access):** Acknowledged the need for git history tools after the wishlist recovery required manual CLI intervention [2, 3].
    *   **W-065 (Gemini-NLM Integration Research):** A new research initiative for Cross-AI workflows, housed in a newly created **Section 10** [3].
    *   **W-066 (Report-Based Extraction Pipeline):** Formalized the concept of using NLM reports for token-efficient data extraction [3, 4].
*   **Indexer v0.2 Update:** The Indexer File Organization System was updated to v0.2. Key changes included adding a `purpose` field to the query manifest schema, updating the folder structure to reflect a `testing/` directory (clearing `_untagged/`), and refining combined pass classification guidance [5].
*   **Archive Workflow Defined (D-042):** A formal protocol was established for completed items: they are appended to `WISHLIST-ARCHIVE_Completed-Items.txt` in the repo and deleted from the NLM source to maintain hygiene [6].

### Current Wishlist Status

*   **Current Version:** **v1.3** [2, 7].
*   **Active Items:** 37 active items across 10 sections [8, 9].

### Maintenance Model (Hybrid Architecture)

Following decision **D-041**, the wishlist is no longer managed as a monolithic text file. It now operates on a **Hybrid NLM/GitHub Model** designed to balance queryability with archival safety [2, 7].

1.  **PRIMARY (Active Management):**
    *   **Location:** HA Suite Wishlist NLM Notebook (UUID: `8b28...041c`) [2].
    *   **Format:** Each active wishlist item exists as an individual text source.
    *   **Function:** This is the interactive layer used for querying and atomic updates [8].

2.  **SECONDARY (Snapshot/Reference):**
    *   **Location:** `_docs/v1.3_REF_Development-Wishlist.txt` [2, 7].
    *   **Format:** A single, human-readable text file.
    *   **Function:** Serves as a periodic snapshot. It is **not** updated on every change, but rather during structural updates or quarterly maintenance (Decision D-043) [6].

3.  **ARCHIVE (Source of Truth):**
    *   **Location:** `WISHLIST-ARCHIVE_Completed-Items.txt` in the GitHub repository [2].
    *   **Function:** The permanent record for completed work. The repository remains the ultimate source of truth for completed items [3].
