Based on the provided sources, here is the status of the `_untagged/` files and the routing architecture as of Session 029:

### **1. State of `_untagged/` Keeper Files**
As of the most recent infrastructure reporting (Session 026), the `_untagged/` directory had accumulated **222 files** [1].
*   **Status:** These files were identified as a mix of operational queries and early testing data.
*   **Plan:** The decision was made to **archive** these pre-branch-tagging files to a directory like `_archive/pre-branch-tagging/` rather than manually sorting them, allowing the system to start clean with the new branching logic [2], [3].
*   **Previous State:** In Session 023, a smaller batch of **18 files** (referred to as "keepers" in Session 022) had been successfully moved from `_untagged/` to `testing/S010` through `testing/S013` folders [4].

### **2. The "33 Remaining Files"**
The specific count of "33 remaining files" does not appear in the provided session logs (Session 001...029). The documented file counts closest to this figure are:
*   **26 files:** The number of "Tier 3" (untagged) queries processed on February 13, as noted in the Session 026 pipeline summary [5].
*   **18 files:** The count of files sitting in `_untagged/` during the Session 022 maintenance pass [6].
*   **17 files:** The number of successful extractions from the Feb 6 and Feb 9 logs analyzed in Session 020 [7].

*If "33" refers to a specific subset identified in Session 030 (which is not in my sources), it likely relates to the specific batch of untagged queries remaining after a partial cleanup or the specific Tier 3 output from a recent day's traffic.*

### **3. Routing Destination: SP03 and CLGYSING Source Pkg**
The routing destination for **SP03** (Source Package 03) and **CLGYSING** files is determined by the **SERAPH Signal String** included in the query.

*   **Structure:** `extracted/{BRANCH}/clgysing/phase2/{PASS}/` [8], [9].
    *   **{BRANCH}:** The project branch where the query originated (e.g., `AWSNBLM` or `NLMINTA`) [8].
    *   **clgysing:** The project identifier (hardcoded from the `PROJECT=clgysing` tag).
    *   **phase2:** The standard phase directory.
    *   **{PASS}:** The pass type code (e.g., `VX`, `TX`, `PE`) [8].

*   **Examples:**
    *   If queried from NLMINTA branch: `extracted/NLMINTA/clgysing/phase2/VX/` [9].
    *   If queried from AWSNBLM branch: `extracted/AWSNBLM/clgysing/phase2/TX/` [9].
