### **Items Affecting the Architecture Reference**

The following items from the **CHANGELOG** and **Wishlist** have occurred after Session 021 (when v4.0 was created) and would require updates to the Architecture Reference:

**1. Infrastructure Upgrades (Session 022)**
*   **EC2 Instance Upgrade:** The instance was upgraded from `t3.micro` to **`t3.small`** on 2026-02-09 [8]. The Reference currently lists `t3.micro` as the baseline.

**2. New Components & Ports (Session 022...023)**
*   **File Browser Tool:** A new web application for browsing the extraction repo was deployed in Session 022 [8, 9].
    *   **New Port:** Adds **Port 8095** (Flask internal) to the port map [9].
    *   **New Service:** Adds `systemd file-browser` service [9].
*   **Indexer Protocol:** The Indexer (v0.1 designed S022, v0.2 S023) is now a core component of the extraction pipeline [10], but is not yet listed in the Component Summary of the Architecture Reference [11].

**3. Resolved Issues (Session 026)**
*   **Chronicler Discovery:** The "Known Issue" regarding Chronicler tools not appearing in the Claude UI [6] was **fixed** in Session 026 by reordering the `flush_pipeline` tool definition [12].

**4. Wishlist & Future Architecture (Session 027+)**
*   **Conductor Service:** The Wishlist notes a key decision (D-038) to build **Conductor** (NLM automation orchestration) as an independent service rather than modifying Majeston [13]. This will eventually add a new component and potential port (W-100) to the architecture.
*   **Infrastructure Hardening:** Pending wishlist items include `jacob-bd` backup/update automation (W-042/043) and a Shell MCP (W-044) [13].
