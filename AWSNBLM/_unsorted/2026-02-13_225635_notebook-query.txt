The provided sources primarily cover the **AWSNBLM** infrastructure branch (Sessions 001...028) and do not contain the full transcripts or detailed finding documents from the **NLMINTA** Phase 3 testing sessions (S018...S020). Consequently, details regarding the "J8 capstone test," specific "Exclusion methodology" steps, and the "Pathway C self-correcting pipeline" mechanics are not explicitly detailed in the text.

However, based on infrastructure discussions and repository logs in AWSNBLM Session 028, the following traces and context regarding these findings are available:

**1. Confirmed Findings via Repository Logs**
AWSNBLM Session 028 records the synchronization of specific finding documents from the NLMINTA branch, confirming their existence and titling [1]:
*   **F98:** `Explicit-Exclusion-Gap-Fill-Methodology-Validated_S019.txt`
*   **F99:** `Report-Tool-Testing-Create-Your-Own-Extraction_S019.txt`
*   **F100:** `Pathway-C-Report-As-Source-Gap-Detection_S019.txt`

**2. Report-Based Extraction (Related to F99)**
Discussions in AWSNBLM Session 028 analyze the "Report-Based Extraction" finding (derived from NLMINTA S019). The key insight is that using NotebookLM's "Create Your Own" report format generates large, structured outputs that live in the NLM Studio [2]. This method avoids consuming Claude's context window tokens until the user deliberately pulls the content [2]. This methodology allows for a "token-efficient pipeline" where reports are batch-generated and then retrieved via the pipeline [3].

**3. D1 Library Methodology (Inferred)**
While the specific "D1 Library methodology" from Phase 3 is not described, the **Indexer Specification** (v0.1) defined in AWSNBLM Session 022 establishes a "Degree Classification" system where **D1 (First Degree)** is defined as "Raw extraction output, direct from query" [4]. This standardizes the "ore" of the research process before it is refined into D2 (organized) or D3 (consolidated) artifacts [4].

**4. Post-Phase 3 Discussion**
Discussions in AWSNBLM Session 028 outline that the completion of NLMINTA Phase 3 validation is a prerequisite for building the **Concept Ledger**, described as the "highest-value downstream product" [5].
*   **Automation Gating:** The implementation of automated ID assignment and entry-level routing (Items B and C in the JSON Engineering Brief) is explicitly "gated by NLMINTA Phase 3 validation" to ensure schemas are stable and outputs are repeatable before engineering begins [6].
*   **North Star:** The Concept Ledger will serve as a master index tracking concepts, confidence, and categories, essentially automating the manual Concept Repository work being done in Phase 2 [5].
