Based on the concept repositories in your source material, here are the top 3 most distinctive vocabulary terms, along with their definitions:

**1. Omniology**
This is the author's core philosophical discipline and the foundation of their work. It is defined as a comprehensive attempt to understand the self, the nature of reality, and the purpose of life, specifically focusing on how the "pursuit of truth" can improve systems ranging from the individual family unit to civilization itself [1-3].

**2. Cultology**
Described as the "unified field theory" or "pathology" derived from Omniology, this term refers to a framework for analyzing relationships, power dynamics, and belief systems [4, 5]. It investigates how "parasitic systems" hijack human potential by interrupting the natural flow of truth and growth, contrasting these with "symbiotic" alternatives [4, 6, 7].

**3. Macro-cult**
This term represents the application of the Cultology framework to civilization at large. It characterizes modern society not as a collection of independent institutions, but as a "distributed cultic architecture" or "advanced parasitic system" that operates across families, businesses, and governments to enforce dependency and subvert genuine freedom [8-10].
