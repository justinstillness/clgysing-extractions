Based on the provided extraction reports, which all analyze the same underlying source material (Package 03: "Update: Thank You for Your Patience..."), the major conceptual themes can be categorized into three main areas: **Methodology & Epistemology**, **Social Systems Framework**, and **Project Architecture & Application**.

### 1. Methodology & Epistemology
This theme covers *how* the author generates knowledge and the philosophical standards applied to the work.

*   **Omniology & The Omniological Approach:** The central philosophy is defined as "Omniology," a pursuit of truth across all domains (self, reality, civilization) [1-4]. The method involves understanding subjects from multiple angles, modeling them in personal frameworks to build **Intrinsic Knowledge** (deep, internalized reasoning), and rejecting "authoritative statements" or surface-level explanations [5-8].
*   **AI as "Force Multiplier" with Human Oversight:** A significant portion of the text details a "third-generation" research system. This system uses AI to organize massive data libraries (7,500+ pages) but strictly maintains human oversight to prevent hallucinations and preserve the author's "voice and judgment" [9-11].
*   **The Pedagogical Spiral Staircase:** To solve the bottleneck of translating deep research into readable content, the author employs a method of introducing concepts accessibly and deepening them recursively ("layer after layer") [12-15].

### 2. Social Systems Framework (Cultology)
This theme outlines the theoretical models used to analyze human relationships and civilization.

*   **Parasitic vs. Symbiotic Dichotomy:** The core moral and epistemic framework.
    *   **Parasitic Systems (The Parasitic Modality):** Defined by the hijacking of human potential and the interruption of the "natural flow of truth." They rely on "extrinsic knowledge," rigid beliefs, and fear [16-19].
    *   **Symbiotic Systems (The Symbiotic Modality):** The positive counterpart, characterized by "truth-centered" functioning, the "intrinsic path" of continual inquiry, and relationships marked by freedom and mutual benefit [20-23].
*   **Macro-Cult & Civilizational Pathology:** The concept that modern civilization itself functions as a "macro-cult"...a distributed parasitic architecture operating across families, businesses, and governments [24-27].
*   **Mechanism of Control:** Parasitic systems are described as using a "Trojan horse" of modern conveniences to conceal a "freedom-destroying payload," creating a "technocratic plantation" where dependency is confused with progress [28-31].

### 3. Project Architecture & Application
This theme explains how the theoretical frameworks are applied to specific outputs.

*   **Cultology vs. Agenda 47 Explained:** "Cultology" is the foundational theoretical framework (the "Unified Field Theory" of relationships) [32, 33]. "Agenda 47 Explained" is a case study applying this framework to the hypothesis that Donald Trump may represent an elite group attempting a transition from a parasitic to a symbiotic civilization [34-36].
*   **Intellectual Honesty & Hypothesis Testing:** The author emphasizes that the political analysis is a hypothesis ("we cannot know for certain") and commits to exploring counter-arguments (e.g., that Trump represents a competing parasitic group) [37-39].
*   **Reclaiming "Birthright":** A recurring motive is the restoration of lost wisdom and truth ("birthright") and the necessity of "eternal vigilance" to maintain a free society once it is recovered [40-43].
