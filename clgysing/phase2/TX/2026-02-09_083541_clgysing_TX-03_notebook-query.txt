The primary infrastructure described in this notebook is the "MCP Workshop Suite," hosted on an AWS EC2 `t3.micro` instance running Ubuntu, which deploys three distinct Model Context Protocol (MCP) services: **Majeston** (for querying NotebookLM via the `jacob-bd` package), **Caliper** (for document analysis), and **Chronicler** (for GitHub repository interaction) [1, 2]. These services function as systemd units and are exposed via **Caddy**, which acts as a reverse proxy handling HTTPS termination and routing requests to their respective internal ports [3, 4]. Supporting this architecture is **SeraphRecorder**, a custom data pipeline that transparently captures Majeston traffic using `socat`, extracts structured data via Python scripts, and archives results to a private GitHub repository [5-7]. The environment is hardened using AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for server access (allowing SSH ports to be closed) and **iptables** for rate limiting, while authentication is managed through periodic Google token refreshes and GitHub Personal Access Tokens [8-10].
