The **SeraphRecorder** pipeline architecture was shaped by the strategic decision to implement a **transparent middleware capture system** rather than modifying the core Majeston MCP code, ultimately utilizing **`socat` for raw TCP proxying** to handle the complex Streamable HTTP and SSE protocols that standard Python wrappers failed to manage reliability [1-3]. This architecture relies on a **dual-stream data model** that simultaneously archives full raw traffic logs (JSONL) for auditing while generating curated, human-readable text extractions for immediate research use [4, 5]. Furthermore, the system was designed around **GitHub as the central delivery mechanism** to ensure version-controlled access and integration with the broader LibForge toolset [6, 7], utilizing embedded **"Signal Strings"** within query text to drive automated file tagging, routing, and metadata generation without altering the underlying API structure [8, 9].
