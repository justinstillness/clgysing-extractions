Based on the **GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1_0_7-DRAFT.txt** source, here is the full text for Section 4.3 Session Lifecycle and its subsections.\
\
### 4.3 SESSION LIFECYCLE\
\
Each chat session follows a lifecycle from initiation through closeout.\
\
Managing this lifecycle ensures continuity and prevents work loss [1].\
\
#### 4.3.1 Session Initiation\
\
Proper session start establishes productive trajectory [2]:\
\
**For New Projects:**\
1. State project name and objective\
2. Provide or develop initial project guide\
3. Establish constraints and parameters\
4. Confirm AI understanding before proceeding\
\
**For Continuation (Via Bootstrap):**\
1. Provide bootstrap file\
2. Request AI confirmation of understanding\
3. Answer any clarifying questions\
4. Confirm readiness before substantive work\
\
**For Branch Sessions:**\
1. Provide branch-specific bootstrap\
2. Clarify relationship to main project\
3. Define scope boundaries\
4. Establish integration expectations [2].\
\
#### 4.3.2 Active Session Management\
\
During productive work [3]:\
\
**Maintain Focus:**\
- Stay within session scope\
- Defer out-of-scope items to appropriate chats\
- Note but don't pursue tangents\
\
**Monitor Tokens:**\
- Be aware of session length\
- Notice if responses become truncated or less coherent\
- Plan exit before limits force it\
\
**Checkpoint Progress:**\
- Confirm understanding at transition points\
- Request file outputs for completed work\
- Don't let substantial work exist only in conversation\
\
**Document Decisions:**\
- Note significant decisions as they occur\
- Capture rationale, not just conclusions\
- These feed the decision log [4].\
\
#### 4.3.3 Session Closeout\
\
Proper closeout preserves work and enables clean resumption [4]:\
\
**Before Ending Any Session:**\
1. Ensure all deliverables are saved as files\
2. Generate bootstrap if continuation is expected\
3. Update session log with work accomplished\
4. Note any decisions made\
5. Identify next actions\
6. Review Backlog Register for any items to carry forward\
7. Export chat transcript (via Claude Exporter or equivalent)\
\
The Session Closeout Checklist (Template TPL-003) provides the complete protocol. The discipline is non-negotiable: sessions end cleanly or work is at risk [5].\
\
#### 4.3.4 Emergency Exit\
\
When token limits approach unexpectedly [5]:\
\
**Immediate Actions:**\
1. Stop substantive work\
2. Request the AI generate a minimal bootstrap immediately\
3. Save the bootstrap\
4. End the session\
\
**Recovery:**\
- Use bootstrap to resume in fresh chat\
- Note the emergency exit in session log\
- Review what caused the headroom misjudgment\
\
**Prevention:**\
- Build larger margins into headroom assessment\
- Use shorter, more frequent sessions\
- Monitor tokens more actively [6].\
\
#### 4.3.5 Phase Transition Sessions\
\
Phase transitions are not ordinary session boundaries. Moving from Phase N to Phase N+1 requires more than tactical handoff...it requires strategic recalibration. This section provides the protocol for phase boundary navigation [6].\
\
**4.3.5.1 Recognizing Phase Boundaries**\
\
Phase transitions occur when:\
- Planned phase deliverables are complete\
- The project reaches a natural inflection point (e.g., research complete, now moving to execution)\
- Work type shifts significantly (e.g., from drafting to review)\
- The bootstrap explicitly indicates phase completion [7].\
\
Not every significant milestone is a phase boundary. Phases are major divisions of work with distinct objectives. If you're unsure whether a transition has occurred, consult your Project Guide...the phase structure defined there is authoritative [8].\
\
**4.3.5.2 Phase Transition Upload Requirements**\
\
At phase boundaries, provide:\
\
**Project Guide:** The authoritative strategic plan. Phase transitions require returning to strategic context, not just tactical state [8].\
\
**Project Roadmap (TPL-010):** Shows the full phase structure, current position, and what the upcoming phase entails. The roadmap is your horizon-level view [9].\
\
**Bootstrap from Prior Phase:** The final session's bootstrap carries forward any tactical details needed for continuity [9].\
\
**Phase-Specific Materials:** If the upcoming phase requires reference materials not previously loaded...research outputs, stakeholder inputs, revised specifications...include them now [9].\
\
**4.3.5.2.1 Token Considerations for Phase Transitions**\
\
Phase transitions require heavier document loading than typical session continuations. This increased context consumption warrants explicit attention [10].\
\
**Before uploading phase transition materials:**\
1. Start a fresh session. Phase transitions should not occur mid-session; the prior session should close out cleanly before the transition begins [10].\
2. Request a headroom assessment before loading documents. Establish baseline capacity to inform loading decisions [10].\
3. Load documents in priority order: Project Guide first, then Roadmap, then Bootstrap. This ensures strategic context is established before tactical details [11].\
4. If materials are extensive, consider providing summaries rather than full documents for reference items that won't require direct editi< 2026/02/11 13:47:04.000927729  length=5505 from=16885 to=22389
ng [11].\
5. After loading, confirm remaining headroom before proceeding with phase planning work. Do not assume sufficient capacity remains [11].\
\
**When Phase Work Involves Substantial Deliverables:**\
If the upcoming phase includes large-scale work...drafting lengthy documents, revising extensive materials, producing multiple deliverables...proactively request that the AI develop a segmentation strategy before execution begins [11]-[12].\
\
A segmentation strategy breaks substantial work into session-sized units:\
- Identify natural division points (sections, chapters, components)\
- Estimate work blocks that fit comfortably within session headroom\
- Plan closeout points where work can pause cleanly\
- Structure bootstraps to carry forward partial progress [12].\
\
This prevents the failure mode of beginning a large deliverable, exhausting context mid-draft, and losing work or producing degraded output. The segmentation conversation happens once, at phase start; the resulting plan guides execution across multiple sessions [12]-[13].\
\
Example prompt: \"This phase requires drafting a 40-page policy document. Before we begin, develop a segmentation strategy...how should we break this into session-sized work blocks with clean handoff points?\" [13].\
\
Cross-reference: Section 4.2.2 (Headroom Discipline), Section 4.2.5 (Token Exhaustion Recovery Protocol) [13].\
\
**4.3.5.3 AI Responsibilities at Phase Boundaries**\
\
When recognizing a phase transition, the AI should:\
\
**Review the Project Guide** to understand the upcoming phase definition as originally planned. Compare this with current project state to identify any drift [14].\
\
**Update the Roadmap** by marking the prior phase complete and updating the current position indicator. This maintains accurate project positioning [14].\
\
**Generate Current Phase Detail**, also called the Phase Execution Brief, which includes:\
- Phase objectives (what this phase should accomplish)\
- Session allocation (estimated number of sessions for this phase)\
- Expected deliverables (tangible outputs by phase end)\
- Success criteria (how to know when the phase is complete) [14]-[15].\
\
**Provide the Horizon View:** a summary that orients the user to where the project has been and where it's going. This prevents the \"head down, lost in the work\" disorientation that accumulates during extended execution [15].\
\
**Confirm Alignment** before proceeding with new phase work. Phase transitions are natural checkpoints for verifying that the project remains on intended trajectory [15]-[16].\
\
**Review the Backlog Register** to assess which deferred items, if any, should be addressed in the upcoming phase or carried forward [16].\
\
**4.3.5.4 User Responsibilities at Phase Boundaries**\
\
**Before the transition session:**\
- Ensure the Project Guide is current. If scope changed during the prior phase, update the Guide before the transition session.\
- Gather all materials for the upcoming phase.\
- Review the prior phase's accomplishments and any open issues [16]-[17].\
\
**During the transition session:**\
- Provide all required documents (Project Guide, Roadmap, Bootstrap).\
- Review the AI-generated phase plan.\
- Confirm or adjust the phase plan before proceeding.\
- Explicitly approve transition to new phase work [17].\
\
**After the session:**\
- Note the phase transition in project records.\
- Archive prior phase materials as appropriate.\
- Ensure the updated Roadmap is saved for future sessions [17].\
\
**4.3.5.5 The Horizon View**\
\
Phase transitions provide natural orientation opportunities. The \"horizon view\" is a deliberate pause to see both backward and forward:\
\
**What We've Accomplished:** Summary of prior phase deliverables, key decisions made, and how the project has evolved [18].\
\
**Where We're Going:** Overview of upcoming phase objectives, expected work, and how this phase connects to project completion [18].\
\
This moment of strategic visibility prevents accumulating drift. When you're deep in execution, it's easy to lose sight of the larger trajectory. Phase transitions force you to lift your head and verify you're still on course [18]-[19].\
\
The horizon view is not optional overhead...it's the mechanism that keeps multi-phase projects coherent across what may be weeks or months of work [19].\
\
**4.3.5.6 Phase Transition Checklist**\
\
Quick reference for phase boundary navigation:\
\
**Before Transition Session:**\
[ ] Project Guide is current (updated for any scope changes)\
[ ] Prior phase deliverables are complete or accounted for\
[ ] Upcoming phase materials are gathered [19]-[20].\
\
**During Transition Session:**\
[ ] Upload: Project Guide, Roadmap, Bootstrap\
[ ] AI generates Current Phase Detail / Phase Execution Brief\
[ ] Review horizon view summary\
[ ] Confirm phase plan alignment\
[ ] Approve proceeding with new phase work [20].\
\
**After Transition Session:**\
[ ] Updated Roadmap saved\
[ ] Phase transition noted in project records\
[ ] Prior phase materials archived if appropriate [20].\
\
Cross-reference: Section 1.4.6.4 provides the user workflow overview for phase transitions. Section 2.5.1 explains the Project Lifecycle (Macro Cycle) in which phases operate. Section 2.7.3 details the AI's Phase Transition Orientation Duty. TPL-010 (Project Roadmap) is the primary document for phase tracking [20]-[21].
