Query:           How can Claude manually trigger the SeraphRecorder extraction cycle or push extracted files to the GitHub repository? Is there a Chronicler tool, bash command, or MCP endpoint that initiates extract.py processing or push-to-github.sh? How was this tested?

================================================================================

To manually trigger the SeraphRecorder extraction cycle or push files to the GitHub repository, Claude can use a specific tool added to the Chronicler MCP, or you can use bash commands via SSH.

### **1. Chronicler Tool (Preferred Method)**
You can trigger the full extraction and push cycle directly from a Claude session using the following tool:

*   **Tool Name:** `Chronicler:flush_pipeline`
*   **Function:** It executes a sequence on the EC2 server to pull the latest repo changes (to prevent conflicts), run the extraction parser on all traffic logs, and push the results to GitHub.
*   **Command Sequence:** Internally, it runs:
    ```bash
    git pull --rebase && python3 extract.py --all && bash push-to-github.sh
    ```

**Note:** If this tool does not appear in your available tool list (due to caching), you can still attempt to invoke it by name, as the server listens for it [1].

### **2. Bash Command (Manual SSH Method)**
If you are logged into the EC2 instance via Termius or SSH, you can trigger the cycle manually by running the underlying commands [2]:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/clgysing-extractions && git pull --rebase && 
cd /home/ubuntu/mcp-logger && python3 extract.py --all && 
bash push-to-github.sh
```

### **3. How Was This Tested?**
The functionality was verified in **Session 018** through the following steps:

*   **Deployment:** The code for `flush_pipeline` was written to `chronicler.py` and the service was restarted [3], [4].
*   **Registration Check:** We confirmed the tool was registered on the server by checking the `server_status` logic, though it was not immediately discoverable in the active Claude session due to manifest caching [5].
*   **Logic Verification:** To prove the tool worked, we manually executed the exact bash command sequence the tool wraps on the EC2 instance [2].
*   **Result:** The manual test successfully picked up 3 new extractions from your parallel testing, synced them, and pushed them to the GitHub repository, verifying that the pipeline logic was fully operational [2], [6].
