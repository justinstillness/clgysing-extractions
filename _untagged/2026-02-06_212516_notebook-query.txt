Based on the sources, here is the current status of the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and git configuration on your EC2 instance:

### 1. Current PAT Status
*   **Location:** A GitHub PAT is currently stored in the `.env` file for the Caliper tool at `/home/ubuntu/document-analysis-mcp/.env` [1].
*   **Usage:** This token is currently **only** used by the `document-analysis-mcp.py` script (Caliper) to make API calls to GitHub (specifically to analyze private repos) [2].
*   **Security Note:** This token was visible in the chat logs during Session 011 (`ghp_...`) [1]. You were advised to rotate it, but in Session 013, we decided **not** to rotate it yet to avoid disrupting the active Caliper service during the pipeline build [3].

### 2. Git Configuration Status
*   **Not Yet Configured:** While `git` is installed on the server (standard Ubuntu), it has **not** yet been configured with your credentials or the PAT for standard git operations (clone/push/pull) [4], [5].
*   **Pending Task:** Configuring `git` to use the PAT (likely via a credential helper or URL embedding) and cloning the `clgysing-extractions` repository are specific tasks scheduled for **Session 014** (the next session) as part of building the "GitHub Push Script" component [5], [6].

### 3. Summary
*   **Token:** Active, stored in `.env`, needs rotation (planned for future).
*   **Git Setup:** Not configured.
*   **Next Step:** In Session 014, we will configure `git` to use this token so the automated pipeline can push extracted research files to your private repository [6].
