Based on the provided sources, here is a comprehensive list of the major themes organized by logical grouping.\
\
### **I. Core Philosophy & Epistemology**\
*   **Omniology:** This is the author's primary meta-framework, defined as the pursuit of understanding the self, the nature of reality, and the purpose of life [1, 2]. It posits that understanding \"truth in all its forms\" can improve every aspect of life, from family dynamics to the organization of civilization [3, 4].\
*   **The Pursuit of Truth:** A central commitment to follow truth wherever it leads, regardless of how uncomfortable the destination might be [1, 5]. This theme frames truth as a \"birthright\" and a spiritual necessity that has been obstructed by modern systems [6, 7].\
*   **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Knowledge:** The author distinguishes between \"intrinsic knowledge\" (built by modeling concepts internally) and \"extrinsic knowledge\" (relying on authoritative statements) [8, 9]. The methodology aims to help readers reason independently rather than accepting surface-level explanations [10, 11].\
\
### **II. The Cultology Framework (Social Systems)**\
*   **The Parasitic Modality:** This theme defines cults not by rituals but by their extractive nature, where systems hijack human potential to turn people into engines of labor and technology extraction [12, 13]. It is characterized by \"epistemic closure\" (rigid dogmatic thinking) and the suppression of inquiry [14, 15].\
*   **The Symbiotic Modality:** Presented as the opposite of a cult, this theme describes systems based on freedom, honesty, creativity, and mutual benefit [16, 17]. Symbiosis is defined by the full flourishing of human relationships and the \"natural flow of truth and growth\" [18, 19].\
*   **The Moral and Epistemic Dichotomy:** The sources assert that all social structures are governed by the binary choice between parasitic (control/extraction) and symbiotic (growth/freedom) modes of operation [20, 21].\
*   **Operational Models of Interaction:** Several specific sub-models are introduced to explain human interaction, including \"The Four Intimacies\" (Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, Spiritual) and \"Contractual Formalism\" (viewing relationships as energetic contracts) [22, 23].\
*   **Ontology of Being:** A structural model describing the human being (Personality ... Soul ... Mind ... Emotion ... Physical Expression) and how parasitic systems use a \"corruption cascade\" to invert this value system [24, 25].\

\
### **III. Civilizational Analysis & Pathology**\
*   **The Macro-Cult:** The extension of the Cultology framework to a civilizational scale, arguing that modern society functions as a \"distributed cultic architecture\" spanning families, businesses, and global institutions [26, 27].\
*   **The Technocratic Plantation:** A metaphor describing modern civilization as a system that offers conveniences and material benefits as a \"Trojan horse\" to conceal a \"freedom-destroying payload\" [28, 29].\
*   **Historical Amnesia:** The idea that generations born into the current system have forgotten what genuine freedom looks like, confusing the \"meager benefits of their free-range plantation\" with actual prosperity [30, 31].\
*   **Counterfeit Transcendence:** The concept that parasitic social orders act as \"counterfeit transcendence mechanisms,\" replacing authentic purpose and connection to God with \"surrogate crystallized worldviews\" [14, 32].\
\
### **IV. Methodology, Production, & Pedagogy**\
*   **The \"Omniological Approach\":** A research method that involves understanding a subject from multiple angles, modeling it conceptually, and integrating it across domains [8, 33].\
*   **Research Scale & Infrastructure:** The sources highlight the massive volume of the author's research (over 7,500 pages of notes) and the development of a \"third-generation\" production system to manage it [34, 35].\
*   **AI as a \"Force Multiplier\":** The specific use of AI tools (like Gemini, Grok, and Claude) to organize and synthesize vast amounts of data without surrendering human voice, judgment, or accuracy [36, 37].\
*   **The Pedagogical Spiral Staircase:** A teaching strategy designed to introduce concepts accessibly and then deepen them recursively so that readers of all levels can find value [38, 39].\
*   **Accountability & Delay:** The author addresses the failure to meet previous publishing deadlines, framing the delay as a period of necessary infrastructure building to ensure future consistency [40, 41].\
\
### **V. Contemporary Application (Agenda 47)**\
*   **The Agenda 47 Hypothesis:** A case study applying the Cultology framework to current events, hypothesizing that Donald Trump may represent an elite group attempting to transition society from parasitic to symbiotic [42, 43].\
*   **Intellectual Honesty & Uncertainty:** A thematic emphasis on hypothesis testing rather than political advocacy, explicitly acknowledging that the \"symbiotic transition\" theory could be wrong and that Trump might represent a competing parasitic group [44, 45].\
*   **Elite Transition Theory:** The exploration of \"large-scale civilizational transformation\" and the conflict between elite groups as the mechanism for moving from one societal modality to another [46, 47].
