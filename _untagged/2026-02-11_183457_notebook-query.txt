**Findings Reports** represent a new artifact class designed to capture empirical discoveries during research or exploration sessions. Unlike other project records that track activities or choices, Findings Reports are synthesis documents organized by **topic** to maximize queryability.

Based on the provided sources, here are the detailed specifications for this artifact:

### **Artifact Class and Indexing**
*   **Artifact Class**: Formalized as a distinct class **FINDINGS** [1].
*   **Indexing Convention (F##)**: Findings use a sequential indexing system formatted as **F##** (e.g., F-01, F-02). Crucially, this index **accumulates across the entire project** and does not reset between sessions, ensuring a unique identifier for every discovery [2], [3].

### **Structured Entry Schema**
Each finding follows a strict schema designed to separate observation from interpretation. The required fields are:
*   **Finding ID**: The unique F## identifier [2].
*   **Discovery**: A concise statement of the observation or insight [4].
*   **Evidence**: Specific data points, test results, or source references that support the discovery [4].
*   **Impact/Implication**: Analysis of how this finding affects the project pipeline, methodology, or thesis [4].
*   **Status/Verdict**: The conclusion regarding the finding (e.g., Validates tool, Identifies gap, Requires further testing) [4].

### **Distinction from Other Logs**
The sources explicitly distinguish Findings Reports from other canonical artifacts based on their function:
*   **Session Logs (LOG)**: These are **chronological** records of *what happened* (activities, outputs, events) during a specific work session [4].
*   **Decision Logs (DECISION)**: These are records of **choices made** (D-###), documenting the rationale and alternatives considered [4].
*   **Findings Reports (FINDINGS)**: These are syntheses of **discoveries made** (F-##).

**Relationship**: There is a directional flow of information where **Findings provide the evidence** that subsequently **informs Decisions** [4].

### **Topical Organization and Queryability**
*   **Topical vs. Chronological**: While Session Logs allow you to find information based on *when* it happened, Findings Reports are organized by **topic** [2]. This structure prevents critical insights from being buried inside long chronological transcripts.
*   **Queryability**: The artifact is explicitly designed to be **highly queryable via NotebookLM** [2]. By isolating discoveries into structured, uniquely indexed entries, the AI can retrieve specific empirical evidence (e.g., "Show me all findings related to token exhaustion") without parsing unrelated session chatter.
