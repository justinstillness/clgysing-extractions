Here is the full text draft for the revised **TPL-002 Bootstrap Template (v2.0)**, based on the drafting session findings.\
\
### TPL-002: BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATE (v2.0)\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-002\
**Version:** 2.0\
**Purpose:** Standard structure for session transitions; enables clean handoff between AI instances with full context preservation, behavioral continuity, and retrieval index maintenance.\
**When to Use:**\
*   End of any chat session that will continue in a new chat\
*   When branching to a parallel workstream\
*   When approaching token limits\
*   When shifting focus requires fresh context\
\
**Cross-reference:** Section 5.5 (Bootstrap Files), Section 4.3.3 (Session Closeout), Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol)\
\
---\
\
### INSTRUCTIONS\
\
Complete this Bootstrap at the end of a chat session before transitioning to a new chat. The Bootstrap captures everything the next AI instance needs to continue work without context loss.\
\
The Bootstrap serves two functions:\
1.  **Context Transfer** ... carrying forward the project state, decisions, and working context that the next AI instance needs.\
2.  **Prompt List** ... explicit instructions telling the next AI what to do at session start, beginning with mandatory behavioral alignment.\
\
**WRITING PRINCIPLES:**\
Write for an AI that has no memory of previous chats. Be explicit about what is decided versus what is still open. Include enough context to orient, but not so much that it consumes the token budget needed for substantive work.\
\
The Bootstrap contains two categories of content:\
*   **STABLE CONTENT** persists across multiple sessions within a phase. It changes only when the project's standing instructions, tools, or behavioral requirements change. Examples: mandatory first action, notebook connectivity references, recurring behavioral reminders, standing constraints.\
*   **DYNAMIC CONTENT** changes every session. It reflects the current state of work and must be freshly written at each closeout. Examples: prior session summary, next actions, open items, headroom notes, response index continuity.\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
This template can be completed through dialog with the AI. Say: *\"Help me complete TPL-002\"* or *\"Walk me through Bootstrap Template.\"* More commonly, the AI generates the Bootstrap proactively as part of the Session Closeout Checklist (TPL-003).\

DYNAMIC STATE ... PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA\
================================================================================\
[DYNAMIC CONTENT ... Update as criteria are met]\
\
Phase [N] completion criteria (current status):\
[...] [Criterion 1] ... COMPLETE\
[...] [Criterion 2] ... COMPLETE\
[~] [Criterion 3] ... IN PROGRESS\
[ ] [Criterion 4] ... NOT STARTED\
\
Assessment: Phase [N] approximately [XX]% complete.\
\
================================================================================\
HEADROOM MANAGEMENT\
================================================================================\
[DYNAMIC CONTENT ... Assess per session]\
\
Estimated session complexity: [LOW / MEDIUM / MEDIUM-HIGH / HIGH]\
\
Token budget considerations:\
- [Note 1 ... e.g., \"Section 4.3 revision is substantial\"]\
- [Note 2 ... e.g., \"Multiple templates to revise\"]\
- [Note 3 ... e.g., \"Will need notebook queries before drafting\"]\
\
Priority if headroom constrains:\
1. [Highest priority item]\
2. [Second priority]\
3. [Third priority]\
\
Monitor:\
- [Specific headroom concern ... e.g., \"TPL-002 revision alone could be\
substantial ... assess before starting\"]\
\
================================================================================\
BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS\
================================================================================\
[STABLE CONTENT ... Persists across sessions within phase]\
[Include only behaviors that field testing shows are prone to being\
forgotten or deprioritized, even when encoded in the Phase Protocol]\
\
- [Reminder 1 ... e.g., \"Connector transparency: narrate all tool calls\
with tool ID, query details, intent, and result summary\"]\
- [Reminder 2 ... e.g., \"Produce discrete draft files, not inline content\"]\
- [Reminder 3 ... e.g., \"Maintain response indexing throughout session\"]\
- [Reminder 4 ... project-specific convention or constraint]\
\
These reminders reinforce Phase Protocol requirements that are critical\
but historically prone to drift during extended sessions.\
\
================================================================================\
CONSTRAINTS AND PARAMETERS\
================================================================================\
[MIXED ... Some persist, some are session-specific]\
\
- [Constraint 1 ... e.g., \"Manual is 13,257 lines ... work in targeted\

- [Constraint 4]\
\
================================================================================\
SESSION REQUIREMENTS\

- [ ] Bootstrap (TPL-002) generated if project continues\
- [ ] Decision Log generated if trigger criteria met\
\
DECISION LOG TRIGGER CRITERIA:\
Generate a dedicated Decision Log file when ANY of the following apply:\
- Three or more decisions were made during the session\
- Any decision affects project scope, timeline, or approach\
- Any decision changes template design or manual structure\
- Any decision will need to be referenced in future sessions\
- User explicitly requests decision documentation\
\
AI SELF-CHECK: Before closeout, evaluate: \"Were decisions made this\
session that future sessions will need to reference, or that affect the\
project's direction?\" If yes, generate Decision Log. If uncertain, ask\
the user.\

\
### TEMPLATE NOTES (v2.0 Changes)\
\
**New Sections:**\
*   **MANDATORY FIRST ACTION:** Forces Phase Protocol review immediately upon upload.\
*   **DYNAMIC STATE (Response Index & Phase Criteria):** Tracks the new indexing system and phase progress explicitly.\
*   **HEADROOM MANAGEMENT:** Explicit planning for token usage and priority degradation.\
*   **BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS:** A stable block to reinforce critical behaviors that AIs frequently drop (e.g., connector transparency).\
*   **NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY:** Now integrated directly into the \"Materials Required\" block.\
\
**Revised Sections:**\
*   **PROJECT IDENTIFICATION:** Added \"Horizon View\" to prevent strategic drift.\
*   **PRIOR SESSION SUMMARY:** Replaces \"Completed Work\" and \"End-of-Session Files\".\
*   **SESSION REQUIREMENTS:** Updated to include the Session Fidelity Report (SFR) and specific Decision Log triggers [1-26].
