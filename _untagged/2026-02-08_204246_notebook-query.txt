Based on the comprehensive corpus of 15 source packages, here is a hierarchical map of the major themes and conceptual clusters within the **Cultology** framework.\
\
The framework is architected as a unified \"field theory\" of relationships, spanning from the internal psychology of the individual to the macro-structure of civilizations, grounded in specific ontological and epistemological commitments.\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 1: The Parasitic vs. Symbiotic Systems Framework**\
**Description:** The central thesis of the project. It posits a binary directional orientation for all social, relational, and civilizational systems. Systems either nurture autonomy and truth (Symbiotic) or extract value through deception and control (Parasitic).\
*   **Sources:** [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].\
*   **Extent:** **Ubiquitous.** This is the governing dichotomy of the entire corpus.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **The Core Definition:** Symbiosis maximizes mutual benefit and agency; Parasitism extracts value while suppressing the host...s growth/truth capacity [1], [3].\
*   **Wound, Then Rule:** The foundational formula of parasitic systems...using trauma to create dependency and suspend critical faculties [1], [3].\
*   **False Symbiosis (The Grand Con):** Advanced parasitic systems that simulate negotiation and freedom (democracy, free markets) to quell revolt while maintaining control [4], [5].\
*   **Service-to-Self vs. Service-to-Others:** A cosmological polarity (drawing from the Law of One) mapping to Parasitic vs. Symbiotic orientations [6].\
*   **The Waterline Model:** A model of class stratification where those \"above the waterline\" have surplus agency/assets, and those below are trapped in survival mode, often maintained by parasitic design [8].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 2: Relational Mechanics & The Four Intimacies**\
**Description:** The structural \"physics\" of human connection. This framework asserts that all interactions occur across four specific channels of exchange, which act as a diagnostic tool for relational health.\
*   **Sources:** [1], [4], [9], [6], [8].\
*   **Extent:** **High.** A foundational pillar used to analyze everything from marriage to economics.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **Physical Intimacy:** Exchange of material resources, space, and body (labor, goods, territory) [1], [9].\
*   **Emotional Intimacy:** Exchange of affect, empathy, and resonance [1], [9].\
*   **Intellectual Intimacy:** Exchange of ideas, beliefs, and meaning. Identified as the **\"Keystone Intimacy\"** and immune system for the others [1], [9].\
*   **Spiritual Intimacy:** Exchange of values, purpose, and alignment with the divine/teleology [1], [9].\
*   **Intimacy Hijacking:** How cults and parasitic systems specifically corrupt each of the four intimacies to create dependency (e.g., weaponizing sex, love-bombing, information control) [1], [9], [6].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 3: Epistemology (Truth, Knowledge, & The Omniological Method)**\
**Description:** The study of how humans know what is true, and how systems control perception. The framework distinguishes between self-verified knowledge and authority-dependent belief.\
*   **Sources:** [10], [3], [4], [11], [6], [12].\
*   **Extent:** **Very High.** The \"Intrinsic Path\" is the proposed solution to parasitism.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Path:**\
    *   *Intrinsic:* Internal validation, open inquiry, willingness to revise beliefs [10], [3].\
    *   *Extrinsic:* Reliance on external authority, dogma, and rigid belief systems for stability [10], [3].\
*   **The Omniological Method:** A disciplined approach to truth-seeking that integrates all perspectives and data without premature dismissal [10], [4].\
*   **Truth as Carrier Wave:** The concept that truth is a literal organizing force (\"Divine Broadcast\") that entrains the mind and soul toward order and growth [11], [6].\
*   **Epistemic Regress & Openness:** The necessity of continually questioning foundations. Parasitic systems block this; symbiotic systems encourage it [6], [12].\
*   **Reality Literacy:** The capacity to decode reality maps vs. territory. Parasitic systems engineer \"Reality Illiteracy\" [10], [6].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 4: Contractual Formalism & Negotiation Theory**\
**Description:** The mechanism by which wills are coordinated. Civilization is defined as a complex web of contracts (trusts).\
*   **Sources:** [4], [9], [5], [6].\
*   **Extent:** **High.** Provides the legal/structural logic for the Symbiotic alternative.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **Honorable vs. Dishonorable Contracts:** Honorable contracts require transparency, volition, and mutual benefit. Parasitic contracts rely on adhesion, opacity, and duress [4], [9].\
*   **The RPFI Standard (Reasonable Person Under Full Information):** A critical diagnostic test. A system is parasitic if a reasonable person, possessing full information and free from duress, would *not* consent to it [6].\
*   **Negotiation Phases (Open vs. Closed):**\
    *   *Open:* Exploration of truth/values.\
    *   *Closed:* Execution/Action. Parasitic systems force permanent closed states (dogma) or permanent open states (chaos) [4], [5].\
*   **Duress:** redefined expansively to include informational, cognitive, and identity pressure [6].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 5: Cult Anatomy & Control Dynamics**\
**Description:** The specific pathology of parasitic groups. This theme integrates external research (Hassan/Singer) with the Cultology framework to map how identity is captured.\
*   **Sources:** [1], [2], [13], [6], [12].\
*   **Extent:** **High.** The diagnostic core of the \"Cultology\" brand.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **The \"Cult of One\":** How an individual can become extrinsically dominated even in isolation through media/ideology [3], [6].\
*   **Identity Fragmentation & The \"Cult Self\":** The creation of a pseudo-identity to survive within a high-control group [13].\
*   **The Ontological Singularity as Trap:** How deep, all-encompassing frameworks can hijack consciousness by destabilizing existing meaning structures (acting as a \"gravity well\") [12].\
*   **Spectacle & Social Induction:** The use of shared emotional events (mass media, rituals) to enforce conformity and bypass critical thinking [6].\
*   **BITE Model Integration:** Mapping Hassan...s Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control to the Four Intimacies [13], [6].\
\

\
### **THEME 6: Ontology & Theology (The \"Why\" of Existence)**\
**Description:** The metaphysical substrate of the framework. < 2026/02/08 20:43:36.000091208  length=2872 from=16885 to=19756
It posits a theistic, purpose-driven universe where personality is a divine fragment.\
*   **Sources:** [1], [11], [6], [7].\
*   **Extent:** **Moderate to High.** Acts as the \"bedrock\" for why symbiosis is objectively superior to parasitism.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **The Gift of Personality:** Personality is not an emergent biological property but a fragment of the Divine/Father [11].\
*   **The Circumpunct Model of Consciousness:** A layered model of being (Surface $\\\ightarrow$ Core) where identity anchors [7].\
*   **Trinity as Ideal Relationship:** The Father, Son, and Spirit as the archetype of perfect, transparent, symbiotic relationship [11], [6].\
*   **Divine Trusteeship:** The concept that humans are meant to be custodians of creation. Parasitism is a violation of this trust [6].\
*   **Theodicy (The Game World):** Evil/Parasitism exists to allow for the genuine choice of the Intrinsic Path (contrast is necessary for free will) [11].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 7: Symbiotic Economy & Civilizational Architecture**\
**Description:** The practical application of the framework to society. It redefines economics not as money-management but as the coordination of \"Causal Permissions.\"\
*   **Sources:** [1], [6], [8].\
*   **Extent:** **Moderate.** The \"solution\" phase of the project.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **Law as the Trunk:** The legal/rule set is the core of civilization; finance is merely a branch. Parasitism corrupts the law first [8].\
*   **Causal Economy:** The true economy is the initiation of causes (choices). Money is a \"trust token\" representing causal contribution [6], [8].\
*   **Trustee/Trustee-in-Training/Bad Faith Actor:** A proposed three-tier citizenship model based on competence and ethical alignment [6], [8].\
*   **Triadic Oversight:** A governance model where every position of power is overseen by overlapping layers of peer and meta-review to ensure transparency [6].\
*   **Multi-Currency Systems:** The proposal for distinct currencies for \"Survival\" (basics) vs. \"Thriving\" (innovation/luxury) to prevent scarcity coercion [8].\
\
---\
\
### **THEME 8: Methodology & Pedagogy**\
**Description:** How the Cultology project itself is constructed and taught.\
*   **Sources:** [10], [14], [4], [6].\
*   **Extent:** **Low to Moderate.** Meta-commentary on the writing process.\
\
**Sub-Themes:**\
*   **Pedagogical Spiral Staircase:** Introducing terms simply, then revisiting them with increasing depth and nuance [10].\
*   **The Omniological Approach to Research:** Synthesizing disparate fields (physics, theology, psychology) to find coherent models [10], [4].\
*   **Semantic Rehabilitation:** Taking loaded terms (like \"cult\") and redefining them precisely to use as diagnostic tools [10].
