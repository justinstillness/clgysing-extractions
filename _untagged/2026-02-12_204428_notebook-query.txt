Based on the sources provided, here are the details regarding Integration Point F-IP7 and the scope of the new Section 12.4 Three-Tier Documentation Architecture.

### F-IP7 Integration Point: Table of Contents
**Integration Point F-IP7** is a specific instruction to update the Table of Contents in the GOV-AIPM v1.0.8 manual to reflect the addition of the new **Section 12.4**.

*   **Location:** Table of Contents (Section 12 entries).
*   **Action:** Add `12.4 Three-Tier Documentation Architecture` immediately after Section 12.3.
*   **Status:** This integration point ensures the new section is discoverable within the "Advanced Patterns" part of the manual (Volume 5).

### Section 12.4: Three-Tier Architecture Scope Details
Section 12.4 introduces a pattern for managing documentation in complex projects to prevent "documentation sprawl" (monolithic files that are hard to navigate) and "scattered fragments" (files with no hierarchy).

The section defines the **Three-Tier Documentation Architecture** as follows:

1.  **Tier 1: Architecture References (System Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** High-level blueprint capturing design philosophy and component relationships.
    *   **Stability:** High (changes rarely).
    *   **Naming Convention:** `[VERSION]_SPEC_[System]-Architecture-Reference.[ext]`
    *   **Content:** System topology, component inventory, design principles.

2.  **Tier 2: Per-Tool / Component References (Operational Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** Detailed specifications for individual tools or components. Bridges architecture to execution.
    *   **Stability:** Medium (updates when specific components change, isolated from other components).
    *   **Naming Convention:** `[VERSION]_REF_[Component]-Reference.[ext]`
    *   **Content:** Configuration details, operational procedures, known issues.

3.  **Tier 3: CHANGELOG (Temporal Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** Sequential record of what changed, when, and why.
    *   **Stability:** Continuously updated (append-only).
    *   **Naming Convention:** `CHANGELOG.[ext]` or `[PROJECT]_CHANGELOG.[ext]`
    *   **Content:** Reverse-chronological entries linking changes to decisions and sessions.

**Additional Scope Covered in Section 12.4:**
*   **When to Apply:** Recommended for projects producing systems with multiple components, software development, or complex governance frameworks. Not recommended for short (<5 sessions) or single-deliverable projects.
*   **Implementation Guidance:** Steps for creating the architecture from scratch or retrofitting existing projects, including folder organization.
*   **Relationships:** Integrates with File Naming (Section 6.1), Notebook Organization (Section 6.2.4), and Phase Transitions (Section 4.3.5).
