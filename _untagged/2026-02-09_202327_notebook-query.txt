The naming conventions and reference list are located in the file **`v1.0_REF_LibForge-Tool-Naming-Reference.txt`**.\
\
**Naming Principles**\
The established principles for naming tools within the LibForge ecosystem are [1]:\
*   **One name per tool:** No duplicates allowed.\
*   **Evocative:** The name should genuinely map to the tool's function for those familiar with the reference.\
*   **Concise:** Short enough for conversational use (e.g., \"run Caliper\").\
*   **Mixed Sourcing:** Both Urantia and craft names are equally valid; the mix is intentional to prevent exhausting a single domain.\
\
**Name Sources**\
The naming system draws from two distinct sources to categorize tool functions [2]:\
1.  **Urantia Book Personalities:** Used for **information and intelligence** tools (e.g., reflection, coordination, recording).\
2.  **Craft & Metalworking Terminology:** Used for **measurement and production** tools (e.g., inventory, precision, construction).\
\
**Current Tool Names and Origins**\
The currently established tools and their specific name origins are:\
\
*   **Majeston** (NotebookLM MCP)\
    *   **Origin:** *The Urantia Book*. Majeston is the \"Chief of Reflectivity,\" a being who coordinates universal communication circuits and acts as a center for reflectivity [3], [4].\
    *   **Function:** chosen because the tool reflects and coordinates information across a distributed network of 87+ research notebooks [5].\
\
*   **Caliper** (Document Analysis MCP)\
    *   **Origin:** Craft/Forge terminology. A caliper is a tool used for precise measurement [6], [4].\
    *   **Function:** Chosen because the tool performs precise measurements (word counts, token estimates) and inventories raw materials before they enter the research forge [5].\
\
*   **Chronicler** (GitHub Repo Interaction Tool)\
    *   **Origin:** *The Urantia Book*. Chroniclers are specialized seraphic beings who maintain organized archives and records [7], [8].\
    *   **Function:** Chosen because the tool manages and organizes the extraction archive produced by the pipeline [9].\
\
*   **SeraphRecorder** (Traffic Capture Pipeline)\
    *   **Origin:** *The Urantia Book*. Named after \"The Recorders,\" an order of seraphim responsible for maintaining records of local systems [10].\
    *   **Function:** Captures and records the traffic between Claude and Majeston [11].\
\
*   **LibForge** (Overarching Framework)\
    *   **Origin:** Original/Craft. A forge is where raw materials are heated and hammered into finished forms [2].\
    *   **Function:** The overarching ecosystem for content research and production [4].
