Based on the sources provided, here is how branching works within the AIPM (Artificial Intelligence Project Management) system:\
\
### **1. How Branching Works**\
Branching in the AIPM system is a mechanism used to manage project pivots, parallel developments, or specific operational focuses (like documentation reviews) without losing the integrity of the main project. It allows for a \"clean slate\" context while retaining connection to the parent project.\
\
*   **Definition:** A branch is established as a distinct project focus derived from a parent project. For example, **NLMINTA** (NotebookLM Integration) was established as a \"branch project from **CLGYSING**\" (Cultology Singles) to explore specific tooling infrastructure [1, 2].\
*   **Branch Shift Protocol:** This is the formal governance mechanism for moving between branches or phases. It involves **\"Husk Removal,\"** which requires discarding obsolete context (the \"husk\") to free up token space (\"headroom\") for the new focus [3, 4].\
*   **Initiation:** A branch is initiated with a **New Bootstrap** document that defines the specific objectives, directives, and required files for that branch, ensuring the AI starts with the correct \"dynamic state\" [3, 5].\
\
### **2. Managing Multiple Branches**\
Multiple branches are managed through \"parallel sessions\" or \"threads\" that operate independently but feed into a shared project ecosystem.\
\
*   **Parallel Execution:** Distinct branches can run simultaneously. For instance, the **AWSNBLM** branch (infrastructure development) was developing tools like \"Chronicler\" and \"SeraphRecorder\" in parallel sessions while the **NLMINTA** branch (methodology testing) was testing them [6, 7].\
*   **Branch Identifiers:** Branches are distinguished by unique project names (e.g., `CLGYSING` vs. `NLMINTA`) and session counters. Specific documentation branches may carry designations like \"Branch 026\" to track their specific provenance [8, 9].\
*   **Specialized Roles:** Branches often have distinct mandates. NLMINTA acts as an \"exploratory infrastructure project\" supporting CLGYSING, while CLGYSING focuses on the core research methodology and content creation [2, 10].\
\
### **3. Sharing Phase Protocols**\
Branches typically inherit the core governance of the parent project while adapting specific protocols to their needs.\
\
*   **Inheritance:** Branches utilize the \"Project Knowledge\" files, specifically the **Phase Protocol** (e.g., `v1.2_PP_CLGYSING-PHASE_1_Base-Protocol`), which serves as the \"background document\" governing behavioral requirements and session management [11, 12].\
*   **Adaptation:** While the base protocol is inherited, branches can adapt frameworks. NLMINTA, for instance, does not follow the strict 6-phase structure of CLGYSING but operates as a support branch with its own adapted phases (Exploration & Calibration) [2, 10].\
*   **Protocol Supplements:** Branches can generate supplements to the protocol, such as the **Connector Transparency Protocol**, which are then integrated back into the Phase Protocol for future sessions [13].\
\
### **4. Maintaining Cross-Branch Context**\
Context maintenance is critical to preventing fragmentation between branches. This is achieved through several distinct mechanisms:\
\
*   **Bootstraps:** The primary tool for continuity. A bootstrap file contains th< 2026/02/10 18:13:52.000046383  length=1144 from=10159 to=11302
e \"dynamic state\" of the project...including backlogs, recent decisions, and token headroom...allowing a new session to pick up exactly where the previous one left off [5, 14].\
*   **Project Knowledge:** \"Single source of truth\" documents (like Master Plans, Specs, and Inventories) are stored in Project Knowledge and loaded into sessions to ensure all branches operate from the same definitions [15, 16].\
*   **NotebookLM as Project Memory:** A significant innovation in the NLMINTA branch is using a NotebookLM notebook (e.g., \"NLMINTA Sessions\") as a repository for all session transcripts and project files. This allows the AI to query past context across different branches and sessions without needing to upload massive amounts of text into the active context window [17, 18].\
*   **Shared Repositories:** Tools like \"Chronicler\" manage file organization in GitHub repositories, creating a shared \"pantry\" or \"staging area\" where files generated in one branch (like extraction outputs) are accessible to others [19].
