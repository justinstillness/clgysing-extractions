Based on the **J5 TX validation test** performed on **Source Package 03 (SP03)** during Session 018, here are the results, schema, and available concept details.

### **J5 TX Validation Test Results**

*   **Target:** SP 03 Repositories (Notebook ID: `1e03c6b6-247d-4ddd-801d-8e435ac291b9`) [1]
*   **Pass Type:** TX (Thematic Concept Extraction) using the **Quality-First** design principle (no truncation, no entry caps) [2].
*   **Status:** **VALIDATED** with 100% schema compliance [3], [4].

#### **1. Quantity and Coverage**
*   **Concepts Extracted:** **14 concepts** (Natural yield, no cap applied) [3], [4].
*   **Quality Assessment:** The extraction demonstrated high fidelity. The "hybrid template" successfully prevented compression drift (synthesis material stayed in the `context_synthesis` field rather than bleeding into `compressed_notation`) [3].

#### **2. Concept Titles and Categories**
While the full list of 14 titles is not explicitly enumerated in the provided source text, the following specific examples and category usage details were documented:

**Identified Concept Titles (Samples):**
*   **"Parasitic Modality"** (Core concept; full 4-sentence quote preserved) [5].
*   **"Elite-led Symbiotic Transformation"** (Edge case; an *inferred* title for a hypothesis described in the text, correctly flagged in metadata as inferred) [5].

**Category Usage:**
*   **Usage Rate:** The extraction utilized **7 of the 10** available categories defined in the schema [3].
*   **Available Categories (Schema Enum):**
    1.  `ontology`
    2.  `epistemology`
    3.  `sociology`
    4.  `psychology`
    5.  `theology`
    6.  `economics`
    7.  `methodology`
    8.  `political_systems`
    9.  `ethics`
    10. `strategy` [6]

#### **3. JSON Schema Used**
The **TX (Thematic Concept Extraction)** schema used for this test was designed to prioritize quality and completeness over speed or formatting constraints.

**Schema Structure:**
```json
{
  "pass_type": "TX",
  "source_notebook": "",
  "entries": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "original_quote": "",
      "compressed_notation": "",
      "context_synthesis": "",
      "related_concepts": [""],
      "category": ""
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total_entries": ,
    "categories_used": [""],
    "extraction_notes": ""
  }
}
```
[2], [7]

**Key Schema Rules & Constraints:**
*   **Fields:**
    *   `original_quote`: Must preserve full source language (no truncation).
    *   `compressed_notation`: Must derive *strictly* from the quote.
    *   `context_synthesis`: Designated field for connections, inferences, and framework positioning (prevents drift).
    *   `category`: Must match one of the 10 enum values (listed above).
*   **Behavioral Instructions:**
    *   "Prioritize QUALITY and COMPLETENESS over entry count."
    *   "Do not truncate. Preserve full source language."
    *   "If a concept doesn't fit the category list, use the closest match and note the mismatch in extraction_notes" [7], [6].

**Note for Exclusion List Building:**
Since the full list of 14 titles was not captured in the session logs, you may need to query the **J5-validation** folder in the repo (created during Session 018 closeout [8]) or the **Degree 1 Datasets** notebook to retrieve the complete list of IDs and titles for your exclusion list.
