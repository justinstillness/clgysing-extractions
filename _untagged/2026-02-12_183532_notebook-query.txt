Based on the **Draft User Behavior Callouts** and **Section 10.3 Revision Draft**, here is the information regarding the placement of Callout 8:

### Exact Placement
Callout 8 (Notebook Maintenance) is explicitly instructed to be placed **within or after Section 10.3.3 (Upload Workflow)**.

*   **Source Instruction:** "Placement: Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity) ... INSERT within or after the upload workflow subsection (10.3.3)" [1].

### Rationale for Placement in 10.3.3
The rationale is **contextual relevance**: placing the user's maintenance duties directly alongside the system description of those same processes.

*   **Content Alignment:** Section 10.3.3 describes the **"Upload Workflow"** and provides the rules for **"What to Upload vs. Skip"** [2, 3]. Callout 8 contains the corresponding user checklist: "After each session: Upload the session transcript... Upload non-ephemeral artifacts..." [1].
*   **Workflow Integration:** Other subsections of 10.3 cover different topics where maintenance is less relevant:
    *   **10.3.1** defines the concept and query models [4].
    *   **10.3.2** covers the querying technique (AI behavior) [5].
    *   **10.3.4** covers organization strategy (folders/structure) [6].
    *   **10.3.3** is the specific operational procedure for keeping the notebook current, making it the logical home for the user's maintenance checklist.

### Discussion in Session Transcripts
While the provided sources do not contain raw chat transcripts of the debate, the **Integration Notes** in the drafting files document the design philosophy that drove this decision:

*   **Visibility Strategy:** The notes state that callouts are "embedded within AI-facing sections to make user responsibilities visible. The surrounding AI-facing content explains what the AI does; the callouts explain what the user does at the same workflow point" [7].
*   **Consolidation Debate:** The drafting notes for Section 10.3 discuss whether to consolidate user tips into Section 10.3 or keep them in Section 10.8 (User-Side Workflow Tips). The decision was to retain 10.8 as a quick reference but **also** embed the guidance in 10.3 because "Section 10.3 is the comprehensive treatment for understanding" [8]. Placing Callout 8 in 10.3.3 ensures the user sees the maintenance requirement while reading the comprehensive definition of the upload workflow.
