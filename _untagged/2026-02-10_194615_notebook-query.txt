Query:           What does the manual currently say about project initiation and the early stages of starting a new project? Is there any formalized concept of rooting, Phase 0, or a structured process for establishing project foundations before execution begins? What sections cover this?

Based on the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.7** manual and the **Revision Findings (Session 032)**, here is the current state of project initiation protocols:

### **1. Current Manual Content (v1.0.7)**
The manual currently treats project initiation as a generic "Project Definition" stage rather than a formalized "Phase 0." It provides a structured process for starting projects, but it does not yet use the term "Rooting" as a formal phase name, nor does it include the "Phase Protocol" architecture.

**Key Sections Covering Initiation:**
*   **Section 1.4.6.1 (Starting Your First Project):** Describes the specific workflow for initiating a project: uploading the manual and **TPL-001 (Project Initiation Form)**, engaging in collaborative design, and generating a **Project Guide** [1].
*   **Section 2.5.1 (Project Lifecycle):** Defines the "Project Definition" phase where objectives and constraints are captured formally [2].
*   **Section 4.1.1 (Chat Types):** Explicitly defines **"ROOT CHATS"** designed for "Strategy, architecture, high-level planning" [3]. This is the closest existing concept to "Rooting," serving as the designated space for establishing scope before execution chats begin.
*   **Appendix H (Quick Start Guide):** Provides a step-by-step "collaborative project design" workflow [4].

### **2. Is "Rooting" or "Phase 0" Formalized?**
**No, not yet.** According to the **Revision Findings (Session 032)**, "Rooting as Phase 0" is a **NEW** concept identified during field testing that is **not** in the current v1.0.7 manual [5].

*   **Current State:** The manual covers project initiation generically. It lacks the specific "sine wave" mental model (where zero-crossings represent transition/planning phases like Rooting) and does not explicitly define Rooting as "Phase 0" with specific exit criteria [5].
*   **Field Finding:** The revision plan notes that "Rooting is ALWAYS Phase 0 of any project" and its specific purpose is to create the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol** (another new artifact not in v1.0.7) [5].

### **3. The Structured Process Currently in Place**
While it lacks the "Phase 0" terminology, the manual *does* prescribe a mandatory foundation-building process before execution:

1.  **Readiness Assessment (Section 1.4.5):** Users must answer five key questions (e.g., "Can I state what I'm trying to produce in one sentence?") before starting. If they cannot, they are directed to an "Exploration Session" instead [6].
2.  **Intake Dialog (Section 3.5):** The manual explicitly forbids "passive transcription" of project forms. The AI is required to "actively probe" definitions, surface assumptions, and challenge vague criteria before drafting the Project Guide [4, 7].
3.  **Project Guide Creation (Section 5.1):** This is the "authoritative, living document" that must be established to define scope, deliverables, and execution plans before active work begins [8].

**Summary:** The manual contains a "Root Chat" architecture and a "Project Definition" phase, but the deeper, formalized concept of **"Rooting as Phase 0"** (including the creation of Phase Protocols) is recognized as a missing element to be added in the v1.0.8 update [5, 9].
