Based on the testing sessions through Session 013, the following extraction capabilities and tool features remain untested or only partially tested.\
\
### 1. `chat_configure` and Custom Prompts (Partially Tested)\
While basic functionality is confirmed, specific behaviors remain open:\
*   **\"Soft\" vs. \"Hard\" Influence:** Testing determined that custom prompts provide \"soft guidance\" (nudging format/IDs) rather than hard instructions (F37). Specifically, instructions to \"flag contradictions\" were ignored in Session 009 tests. It remains untested whether **stronger, more explicit prompt engineering** can force adherence to complex analytical directives.\
*   **Character Limits:** The tool definition suggests a 10,000-character limit, while the UI suggests 5,000. This boundary has not been formally stress-tested to confirm which limit applies through the MCP API.\
*   **Persistence:** It is not fully verified if `chat_configure` settings persist reliably across long durations or different sessions without needing re-application.\
\
### 2. `source_ids` Filtering (Partially Tested)\
Source isolation works (validated in Session 003), but a key boundary test remains:\
*   **Cross-Notebook Query Bleed (Test 7):** It is untested whether querying a single source within a consolidated notebook (via `source_ids`) produces identical results to querying that source in a dedicated, isolated notebook. We do not yet know if \"bleed-through\" or noise from adjacent sources occurs despite filtering.\
\
### 3. `template-as-source` Methodology Limits (Partially Tested)\
*   **Passive vs. Active Influence:** Testing confirmed that templates uploaded as sources (e.g., Domain Taxonomy) do **not** passively influence extraction (F38). They are treated as content to be queried, not instructions.\
*   **Framework Lens Integration:** While \"Thesis-as-Lens\" worked for structuring output (F50), we have not yet tested **loading a raw external source** (e.g., a Hassan book without Claude's prior synthesis) alongside a Cultology framework document to see if NLM can perform *genuine* integration bridging two distinct semantic domains (F19/OQ-7).\
\
### 4. Multi-Notebook Workflows (Largely Untested)\
*   **Agentic Chains:** The exploration backlog lists \"Agentic Multi-Notebook Query Chains\" as deferred. We have not tested workflows where Claude autonomously chains queries across multiple notebooks to synthesize a meta-report.\
*   **Cross-Notebook Research:** Workflows for extracting and synthesizing content across different project notebooks simultaneously remain undefined and untested.\
\
### 5. Caliper Integration with Extraction (Untested)\
*   **Segmentation Strategy:** Caliper was successfully tested for generating inventory metadata (word counts, etc.) in Session 009/013. However, using that data to **drive extraction segmentation** (e.g., \"Use Caliper to split this 120k word source into 20k chunks for NLM proce< 2026/02/10 01:18:36.000517051  length=2009 from=8693 to=10701
ssing\") has not been executed. We know NLM word counts are unreliable (F07), making Caliper essential, but the actual handoff workflow is untested.\
\
### 6. Chronicler Workflows for Post-Processing (Untested)\
*   **Routing & Organization:** While the **SeraphRecorder** capture pipeline is active and `extract.py` is parsing Signal Strings (Session 013), the **Chronicler** tool's ability to organize, sort, and retrieve these files from the GitHub repository into a working session has not been tested. The \"Post-processing\" loop...taking captured files and feeding them back into a new NotebookLM notebook or Claude context...is currently theoretical.\
\
### 7. Other Untested Capabilities\
*   **Extraction Ceiling/Degradation:** We successfully tested Theme Mapping (TM) on a 362k-word corpus and ~6,000 pages of raw dialogue (Session 012/013). However, we have **not discovered the upper limit** where quality degrades or errors occur.\
*   **Direct ArgBlock Construction:** Hypothesis F51 suggests a \"Thesis-Lens\" extraction might allow bypassing degree-one concept extraction to build ArgBlocks directly. This shortcut workflow is untested.\
*   **PDF vs. Markdown Quality (OQ-22):** It is unknown if source format affects extraction quality (e.g., does a clean Markdown export yield better concepts than a PDF export of the same chat?).\
*   **Determinism (OQ-23):** We have not formally tested if running the exact same query on the exact same source produces identical results every time.\
*   **Studio Artifacts:** `mind_map`, `audio`, and `video` generation tools have not been assessed for research utility.\
*   **Report Readability:** We have not fully validated the workflow of generating a Report via `studio_create`, exporting it to Google Docs via `export_artifact`, and reading it back via `google_drive_fetch` as a standard retrieval path (though confirmed as viable in F09).
