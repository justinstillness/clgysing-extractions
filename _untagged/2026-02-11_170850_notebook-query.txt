**Insight Capture Mechanism and Out-of-Phase Backlog**

The Insight Capture System is a formal mechanism designed to resolve the tension between maintaining focus on current objectives and preserving valuable ideas that arise tangentially. This system operates through an "Out-of-Phase Backlog" that captures valuable ideas arising outside the current phase scope, preventing scope creep while ensuring nothing valuable is lost [1], [2].

**Preventing Scope Creep**
To manage scope creep during sessions, the AI coordinator is assigned a "Scope Monitoring Duty" [3]. The AI must:
*   **Detect** when a request extends beyond the defined phase scope [3].
*   **Pause and Flag** the issue explicitly before proceeding [3].
*   **Propose Options**: The AI offers to update the scope, adjust the request, or create a backlog item [3]. The AI is forbidden from silently expanding scope [3].

**Two-Phase Workflow**
The system utilizes a specific two-phase workflow to handle these captures:

*   **Phase 1: Capture (In-Session)**
    1.  An out-of-scope idea arises, flagged by the AI (via auto-detection) or the user [2].
    2.  A brief, containable survey (3...5 questions) is conducted to capture the core concept immediately [2].
    3.  A **Backlog Item Report** is generated with provenance data [2].
    4.  Work immediately continues on the current scope, minimizing interruption [2].

*   **Phase 2: Evaluation & Routing (Dedicated Session)**
    1.  Accumulated backlog items are reviewed in a dedicated session [2].
    2.  Each item is evaluated for merit and feasibility [4].
    3.  Items are routed to their appropriate destination: a new component/feature, a future task, a specific document update, or discarded if not actionable [4].

**Backlog Item Schema**
The Backlog Item Report follows a structured schema to ensure consistency and traceability [4]:
*   **ID:** Backlog-Item-[NNN]
*   **Description:** Concise statement of the idea.
*   **Context:** What triggered the idea (provenance data).
*   **Potential Impact:** Why the idea matters.
*   **Suggested Routing:** Where it should go.
*   **Priority Assessment:** Initial weight/importance.
*   **Status:** Tracks progress from CAPTURED ... EVALUATED ... ROUTED.

**Backlog Register and Routing**
The **Backlog Register (TPL-023)** serves as the central living document for these items, acting as part of a "Reporting Triad" alongside the Project Roadmap and Project Closure Report [5]. The register distinguishes between:
*   **Intake Queue:** Raw captures awaiting triage [6].
*   **Active Backlog:** Confirmed and prioritized items (High/Medium/Low) [7].
*   **Version Backlog:** Items explicitly designated for future project versions [8].

Items are routed based on their evaluation. They may be transferred to the **Project Roadmap** for future phases, held in the **Parking Lot** for uncertain future value, or documented in the **Project Closure Report** as deferred items for follow-on projects [5], [9].
