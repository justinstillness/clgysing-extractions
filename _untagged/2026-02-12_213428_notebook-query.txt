Here is the full text draft for the revised TPL-005 Session Log (v2.0), based on the drafting session found in the source documents.\
\
### **DRAFT ... TPL-005 SESSION LOG TEMPLATE (REVISION)**\
\
**Target:** TPL-005 in Appendix A (REPLACES existing template)\
**Version:** 2.0\
**Drafted:** Session 034 [1]\
\
---\
\
#### **TPL-005: SESSION LOG**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-005\
**Version:** 2.0\
**Purpose:** Record what occurred in a chat session for continuity, project tracking, audit trail, and fidelity verification. Includes embedded Session Fidelity Report (SFR) for structured assessment of session quality and handoff readiness.\
**When to Use:** At the end of every AI chat session, as part of the closeout sequence (Section 4.3.3).\
**Cross-reference:** Section 5.4 (Session Logs), Section 4.3.3 (Session Closeout), TPL-003 (Session Closeout Checklist)\
\
---\
\
#### **INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
Complete a Session Log at the end of every AI chat session as part of the closeout protocol. The log provides a running record of project activity and serves as the structured companion to the full chat transcript.\
\
Session Logs are distinct from other closeout artifacts:\
*   **Session Log:** Records what happened (activities, outputs, fidelity)\
*   **Decision Log:** Records what was decided (choices, rationale, alternatives)\
*   **Bootstrap:** Carries forward what the next session needs to know\
*   **Chat Transcript:** Complete verbatim record of the conversation\
\
The Session Log serves dual audiences:\
*   The user, for quick orientation when reviewing project history\
*   The next AI instance, for understanding what was accomplished and what remains\
\
**FILE NAMING:**\
`[###]_session-log.txt`\
Example: `034_session-log.txt`\
\
For sessions with distinctive scope, a descriptive suffix may be added:\
Example: `013_session-log_(StressTest-SignalStrings).txt`\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
This template can be completed through dialog with the AI. Say:\
*\"Help me complete TPL-005\"* or *\"Walk me through Session Log.\"*\
More commonly, the AI generates the Session Log proactively as part of the closeout sequence.\
\
**Tips:**\
*   Keep entries concise ... this is a summary, not a transcript\
*   Reference the Decision Log for decision details rather than duplicating\
*   Note issues and blockers even if unresolved; they inform future sessions\
*   The SFR section requires honest assessment, not optimistic reporting\

\
#### **TEMPLATE NOTES**\
\
**COMPARISON WITH v1.0 (PREVIOUS VERSION):**\
The following sections are **NEW** in v2.0:\
*   **SCOPE OBSERVATIONS:** (planned vs. actual, emergent items)\
*   **PHASE PROGRESS:** (completion criteria tracking)\
*   **RESPONSE INDEX REGISTER:** (full index listing)\
*   **SESSION FIDELITY REPORT ... EMBEDDED:** (comprehensive fidelity assessment)\
*   **File Class annotation:** throughout\
\
The following sections are **REVISED** in v2.0:\
*   **HEADER:** Added File Class, expanded session type\
*   **SESSION OBJECTIVE:** Structured with Primary/Secondary\
*   **WORK ACCOMPLISHED:** Added \"Objective Achieved\" assessment\
*   **DECISIONS MADE:** Simplified to table format with count\
*   **ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:** Added Status column with defined values\
*   **FILES PRODUCED:** Added File Class column\
*   **BOOTSTRAP STATUS:** Added suggested next session name\
\
The following sections from v1.0 are **REMOVED** or **CONSOLIDATED**:\
*   **CHAT EXPORT STATUS:** Moved to TPL-003 (Closeout Checklist) where it is a user action, not a session log entry\
*   **SESSION METRICS (Optional):** Replaced by the more comprehensive SFR\
*   **NEXT SESSION NOTES:** Consolidated into SFR's Next Session Projection\
*   **DURATION:** Removed as a standalone field (approximate timing is less useful than the substance of what was accomplished)\
\
**SESSION FIDELITY REPORT (SFR) GUIDANCE:**\
The SFR is generated as part of every Session Log. It provides a structured assessment that goes beyond \"what happened\" to evaluate \"how well did it go and what does the next session need to know.\"\
\
The SFR serves three purposes:\
1.  **Quality verification** ... honest assessment of whether objectives were met and to what degree\
2.  **Continuity assurance** ... explicit handoff context < 2026/02/12 21:35:29.000815032  length=1530 from=31589 to=33118
that the Bootstrap draws from\
3.  **Pattern detection** ... over multiple sessions, SFR entries reveal patterns in scope management, estimation accuracy, and recurring gaps\
\
The SFR should be written honestly. If objectives were only partially met, say so. If the AI's performance degraded due to context exhaustion, document it. If scope expanded beyond what was planned, note whether that was productive headroom opportunism or uncontrolled drift. The SFR is a diagnostic tool, not a success narrative.\
\
**User Verification:** The SFR is generated in DRAFT status. The user may confirm accuracy (changing to CONFIRMED) or note corrections. This verification step is encouraged but not blocking ... an unverified SFR is still valuable for continuity.\
\
**FILE STRUCTURE GUIDANCE:**\
Session Logs are maintained as individual files per session:\
`[###]_session-log.txt`\
\
This differs from the v1.0 guidance which suggested a single append-only file per project. Individual files per session are recommended because:\
*   Each file can be uploaded to notebooks independently\
*   Individual files are easier to reference from Bootstraps\
*   File size remains manageable for long-running projects\
*   Session identification is immediate from the filename\
\
For projects using notebook connectivity, individual session logs should be uploaded to the project notebook after each session for context recovery purposes.
