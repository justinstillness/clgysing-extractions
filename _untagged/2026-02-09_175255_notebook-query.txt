Based on the "Manual Flush" workflow established in Session 018 and the Chronicler Quick Reference, the exact command to run the extraction script is:

`cd /home/ubuntu/mcp-logger && python3 extract.py --all` [1], [2]

**Details:**
*   **Full Path:** The script is located at `/home/ubuntu/mcp-logger/extract.py` [3].
*   **Flags:** The `--all` flag is recommended because the traffic logger (`socat`) may be writing to a file named after a previous date (due to UTC timing or service restart schedules). Using `--all` ensures the script processes all available traffic logs, including today's active log [4], [5].
*   **Default Behavior:** If you omit the flag (`python3 extract.py`), it defaults to looking for a log file named with **today's UTC date** (e.g., `2026-02-09.log`) [6], [7].
