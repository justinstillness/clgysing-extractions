Based on the **Revision Findings & Plan** document (Session 032), **Category 7: User Behaviors & User Guide** addresses the \"missing 10%\" of the AIPM system...the critical user-side actions required for the system to function effectively [1].\
\
Here are the specific findings for each behavior you requested:\
\
### 1. Project Handle Naming\
*   **Definition:** A short, consistent tag (3...10 characters) used to identify the project across all contexts [2].\
*   **Usage:** It must be used in all naming conventions for files, sessions, and folders [2].\
*   **Examples:** `GOV-AIPM`, `CLGYSING`, `AWSNBLM` [2].\
\
### 2. New Chat Notepad System\
*   **Mechanism:** Maintain an external notepad (e.g., Google Keep) to prepare session start prompts before opening the AI interface [2].\
*   **Contents:**\
    *   **Chat Name Field:** Pre-formatted and ready to copy-paste [2].\
    *   **Standard Opening Line:** E.g., \"Please review and let me know if you have any questions\" [2].\
    *   **Context References:** NotebookLM IDs and descriptions [3].\
    *   **Behavioral Reminders:** Explicit instructions for things the AI tends to forget (e.g., specific formatting or narration protocols) [3].\
    *   **Between-Session Notes:** Any context updates or ideas that occurred since the last session [3].\
\
### 3. Session Naming\
*   **Convention:** `[session#] [PROJECT-HANDLE] ([semantic descriptor])` [3].\
*   **Examples:** `001 CLGYSING (Rooting and Project Architecture)` or `023 AWSNBLM (File Fix and Index Alpha)` [3].\
*   **Critical User Action:** The user **must** manually rename the chat in the Claude UI to match this convention, replacing the default AI-generated name [3].\
\
### 4. File Organization\
The findings propose a standardized project folder structure [4]:\
*   `/[Project Name]/`\
    *   `/Chats/` (Each session gets its own folder containing the bootstrap, session log, transcript, and artifacts)\
    *   `/Decision Logs/`\
    *   `/Artifacts/` (Organized by phase, type, or function)\
    *   `/Guides/` (Project guides and reference docs)\
    *   `/Phase Protocols/` (Current protocol at top level; `/Old/` subfolder for superseded versions) [4].\
\
### 5. Post-Session Housekeeping\
A mandatory sequence to perform immediately after a session ends [5]:\
1.  **Download Artifacts:** Use the \"show all artifacts\" button and place them in the session folder [5].\
2.  **Verify Bootstrap:** Check that the session number incremented correctly (sometimes jumps by 2) and the branch handle is correct [5].\
3.  **Update Notepad:** Copy the *next* session's name from the bootstrap into your New Chat Notepad [5].\
4.  **Download Transcript:** Export via tool (e.g., Claude Exporter) and save to the session folder [5].\
5.  **Upload to NotebookLM:** Upload the transcript and any non-ephemeral artifacts (specs, reports) to the project notebook [6].\
\
### 6. Pre-Session Housekeeping\
The preparation workflow before initiating a new chat [6]:\
1.  **Update Notepad:** Ensure the New Chat Notepad has the correct chat name, notebook references, and behavioral reminders [6].\
2.  **Start Chat:** Open a new chat with the **Phase Protocol** loaded in Project Knowledge [6].\
3.  **Paste & Attach:** Paste the notepad content and attach the Bootstrap + Session Log from the previous session [7].\
4.  **Rename:** Once the response loads, paste the chat name from your clipboard to rename the sessi< 2026/02/11 22:56:15.000529152  length=1070 from=8693 to=9762
on UI [7].\
\
### 7. Prompting Discipline\
*   **Composition:** Compose complex responses in an external notepad first to prevent accidental sends [7].\
*   **Input Formula:** When providing direction on decisions, use the formula: `[State your thinking] + [Provide direction] + \"Let me know if you think there's a better way or if my thinking is incorrect\"` [7].\
    *   *Rationale:* You must explicitly invite the AI to disagree; otherwise, it defaults to compliance [8].\
\
### 8. NotebookLM Maintenance\
*   **Routine:** Upload transcripts and non-ephemeral artifacts between sessions to maintain the \"deep context recovery layer\" [8].\
*   **Direction:** When the AI needs context not in the loaded files, explicitly direct it: \"The information you're looking for is likely in the NotebookLM notebook. Please begin targeted queries...\" [8].\
*   **Process:** Encourage \"exhaustive querying\" (query ... summarize ... ask gap questions ... repeat) [9].
