Based on the provided sources, particularly the session logs and specifications regarding the AIPM (Artificial Intelligence Project Management) framework used in the **CLGYSING** and **NLMINTA** projects, here is the breakdown of the Phase Protocol document:

### **What is the Phase Protocol Document?**
The **Phase Protocol (PP)** is the foundational governance document that defines the specific rules, behavioral requirements, and scope for a specific phase of a project. It serves as the static "constitution" for that phase, ensuring the AI maintains the correct persona, operational boundaries, and formatting standards throughout the duration of that phase [1, 2].

*   **Function:** It establishes the "Phase-Stable Boundary," defining what work is in-scope versus out-of-scope for the current stage of the project [3].
*   **Usage:** It is stored in "Project Knowledge" and must be reviewed as a "Mandatory First Action" at the start of every session to ensure alignment [1, 4].
*   **Content:** It includes behavioral requirements, file naming conventions [5], and specific protocols relevant to the current project phase (e.g., `v1.2_PP_CLGYSING-PHASE_1_Base-Protocol`) [1].

### **Differences from Bootstraps and Project Guides**

The Phase Protocol works in concert with Bootstraps and Project Guides, but they serve distinct functions within the AIPM framework:

| Document Type | Purpose | Nature of Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase Protocol** | **Governance & Rules.** Defines *how* the AI should behave and the boundaries of the current phase [1, 3]. | **Static** (usually remains unchanged throughout the specific phase) [6]. |
| **Bootstrap** | **Continuity & Handoff.** Tracks the "dynamic state" of the project, including current token headroom, active backlogs, and recent decisions [7, 8]. It bridges the gap between the previous session and the current one [9]. | **Dynamic** (updated at the end of *every* session to facilitate the next) [8]. |
| **Project Guide** | **Context & Operations.** Contains the subject matter expertise (e.g., Cultology framework overview) or specific operational procedures (e.g., "Guide 2 Operational Procedures") [10, 11]. | **Reference** (Instructional material on *what* to do or *what* the subject is) [11]. |

### **Creation and Evolution Across Phases**

The Phase Protocol is created and updated during **Phase Transitions**. The AIPM framework utilizes an **8-step transition protocol** to move from one phase to the next (e.g., from Phase 1 "Material Inventory" to Phase 2 "Extraction") [5, 6].

1.  **Husk Removal:** When a phase is complete, obsolete context (the "husk") is discarded [12].
2.  **Redrafting:** A "New PP draft" (Phase Protocol) is created to reflect the rules and scope of the *new* phase [6].
3.  **Validation:** This new protocol is reviewed, tested, verified, and exported before work in the new phase begins [6].

This process ensures that the governance rules evolve to match the changing needs of the project (e.g., shifting rules from "Inventory" to "Drafting").

### **Relationship to Session Bootstraps**

The Phase Protocol and the Session Bootstrap are tightly coupled during the **Session Lifecycle**:

1.  **Initiation Pair:** A session begins by absorbing *both* the Phase Protocol (for static rules) and the Bootstrap (for dynamic context) [6].
2.  **Trigger Mechanism:** The Bootstrap explicitly directs the AI to read the Phase Protocol. A standard Bootstrap instruction is: *"Review the AIPM Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge... and confirm adherence"* [1, 4].
3.  **Continuity vs. Governance:** While the Bootstrap tells the AI *where we left off* (e.g., "Last session ended at index [13]"), the Phase Protocol tells the AI *how to behave* while doing the work [1, 14].
