Based on the prior findings from the NLMINTA sessions, particularly Sessions 009, 010, and 014, we have established a clear picture of NotebookLM...s (NLM) variability, stability, and compression behaviors.\
\
Here is a summary of the findings regarding NLM's consistency and output limitations.\
\
### 1. Semantic Stability and Determinism: The \"Sampling\" Behavior\
NLM is **probabilistic, not deterministic**. When given the same query under slightly different conditions (or even identical conditions), it does not produce identical results. Instead, it acts as a \"sampler\" of the source material.\
\
*   **Complementary Sampling (F36):** In Session 009, running identical queries with different configurations (default vs. custom) revealed that neither result was a strict superset of the other. Each pass surfaced unique concepts the other missed. For example, a default run found \"Contractual Formalism,\" while a custom run found \"Counterfeit Transcendence Mechanism\" [1, 2].\
*   **Implication:** To achieve exhaustive extraction, one must treat NLM outputs as *samples* rather than definitive inventories. The methodology recommends running \"dual-config\" extractions (one default, one custom) and merging the results to maximize yield [1, 3].\
\
### 2. The Impact of Threading (`conversation_id`)\
Threading (chaining queries within the same conversation context) does not merely repeat information; it causes NLM to \"resample\" the corpus from a different angle, often increasing depth or shifting thematic focus.\
\
*   **Resampling vs. Repetition:** In Session 014, threading tests revealed that a threaded follow-up query produced **~30% thematic variance** compared to a fresh query. While 70% of the themes overlapped, the threaded version surfaced entirely new concepts (e.g., \"Theological Anthropology\") that the unthreaded version missed [4].\
*   **Depth Accumulation:** Threading tends to produce richer responses. In a test on \"patience,\" the unthreaded response had 6 citations; the threaded response had 12 citations and introduced a novel \"accountability\" framing not present in the first [5].\
*   **Partial Exclusion (F72):** When explicitly asked to find *new* concepts in a threaded conversation, NLM successfully excluded about 70% of previously found items. However, it still repeated ~30% of them, though often with enriched content or new quotes [6, 7].\
\
### 3. The Impact of `chat_configure`\
The `chat_configure` tool functions as a \"soft guidance\" layer rather than< 2026/02/12 01:22:09.000663774  length=2875 from=8693 to=11567
 a hard constraint system.\
\
*   **Soft Influence (F37):** Custom prompts set via `chat_configure` can nudge formatting (e.g., spontaneously adding concept numbering), but NLM may ignore complex analytical directives (e.g., \"flag contradictions\") if the query does not explicitly reinforce them [8].\
*   **Query Override:** If a specific query contradicts the `chat_configure` settings (e.g., asking for casual prose when the config demands JSON), NLM will prioritize the query over the configuration [9, 10].\
*   **Response Length (F35):** Setting `response_length=\"longer\"` does **not** increase the *number* of concepts extracted. Instead, it increases the depth (word count/detail) of the concepts it does find. It trades breadth for depth [11].\
\
### 4. Information Compression and the \"Output Envelope\"\
A critical finding is that NLM operates under a fixed **\"Output Envelope\"** (F52). It appears to have a maximum response budget (likely token-based) that it distributes across the requested items.\
\
*   **Zero-Sum Distribution:** When you add contextual constraints (like a glossary or thesis lens) or ask for multiple types of data at once, NLM does not produce *more* text; it redistributes the budget.\
    *   **Combined vs. Separated Passes (F44):** When asked to extract Concepts, Vocabulary, and Thesis Strings in a single \"Combined\" query, the yield dropped significantly compared to running three separate queries. Vocabulary extraction dropped by **56%** and concept extraction by **29%** in the combined pass [12].\
    *   **Contextual Redistribution (F52):** When a thesis lens was applied, NLM extracted fewer concepts (12 vs. 18 in the control), but the entries were deeper and more mechanistically mapped to the thesis [13].\
\
### 5. Consolidation Bias\
NLM has a native tendency toward synthesis over enumeration.\
*   **Consolidation (F22):** In Session 003, it was noted that NLM tends to fold related sub-concepts into larger parent concepts (e.g., folding \"Intrinsic Knowledge\" into \"Omniological Approach\") rather than listing them as discrete items [14, 15].\
*   **Asset vs. Liability:** This bias is a liability for granular extraction (Stage 1) but becomes an asset for semantic surveying (Stage 2), where the goal is to cluster related ideas [16, 17].\
\
### Summary Recommendation\
To mitigate variability and compression loss:\
1.  **Separate Passes:** Never combine extraction types (e.g., don't ask for Glossary and Concepts in one prompt) [18].\
2.  **Dual Configuration:** Run extraction passes twice (once with default config, once with custom) and merge the results [3].\
3.  **Threaded Saturation:** Use threaded queries to \"resample\" the corpus until the system stops producing novel themes [19, 20].
