Based on the sources from Session 022, the **exact text** of the Caddyfile configuration for the File Browser is not explicitly printed in the chat logs (it was contained in a generated artifact file, `v1.0_SPEC_File-Browser-Build.txt`).

However, the configuration details and architecture were explicitly specified during the session.

**File Browser Caddyfile Configuration (Derived from Build Spec)**

Based on the build specification discussion [1-3], the configuration uses **port 8095** and **handle_path** to strip the prefix.

*   **Route:** `/files/*` (served at `https://mcp.justinstillness.com/files/` [4])
*   **Directive:** `handle_path` (indicated by the note "Caddy strips the prefix" [3])
*   **Reverse Proxy:** `localhost:8095` [2]

The configuration block would look like this:

```caddy
handle_path /files/* {
    basicauth {
        justin <hashed_password_placeholder>
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:8095
}
```

**Basic Auth Details**

*   **Username:** **justin**
    *   This username was suggested by the assistant ("just tell Claude Code... username justin") [4, 5].
*   **Password:** **Not available in the sources.**
    *   The password was not recorded in the logs for security reasons. The user entered it directly into Claude Code during the deployment process [5]. The user later noted they "put the password and user name in a few times" but encountered a loop issue [6].

**Note on Status:** As of the end of Session 022, the basic auth was causing a redirect loop, and the issue was slated for troubleshooting in the next session [6, 7].
