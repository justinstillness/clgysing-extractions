\
SECTION 15: EMAIL INTEGRATION\
\
================================================================================\
\
Email remains a primary business communication channel. AI integration with\
\
email workflows requires attention to both input processing (using email as\
\
AI input) and output processing (using AI to generate email content).\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
15.1 Email-to-AI Workflow\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
Email content frequently requires AI processing: summariz< 2026/02/12 21:32:04.000351056  length=8192 from=26543 to=34734
ation, response\
\
drafting, information extraction, or action item identification. This\
\
subsection addresses patterns for bringing email content into AI workflows.\
\
Email Ingestion\
\
Email enters AI context through several paths:\
\
Direct paste. For individual emails, copying content directly into the\
\
chat is often sufficient. Strip headers unless they're relevant to the\
\
task.\
\
Batch processing. For multiple emails, compile into a structured\
\
document with clear email boundaries.\
\
Attachment handling. Email attachments should be processed separately\
\
and provided to AI in appropriate format. Don't assume AI can access\
\
attachments from email paste.\
\
Privacy Considerations\
\
Email content often contains sensitive information:\
\
Redaction protocol. Before providing email to AI, review for content\
\
that shouldn't be processed externally. Redact personal information,\
\
confidential business data, or privileged content as appropriate.\
\
Context limitation. Email content may persist in AI conversation\
\
history.\
\
Common Email Processing Tasks\
\
Summarization. \"Summarize the key points from this email thread.\"\
\
Response drafting. \"Draft a response that addresses points A, B, and C.\"\
\
Information extraction. \"Extract all dates, action items, and named parties.\"\
\
Thread synthesis. \"Summarize the discussion arc and current status.\"\
\
Sentiment analysis. \"What is the sender's apparent emotional tone?\"\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
15.2 AI-to-Email Workflow\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
AI-generated email content requires careful handling before sending.\
\
Email reaches external parties; errors and tone mismatches have\
\
relational consequences.\
\
Generation Protocol\
\
When generating email content:\
\
Context provision. Provide relationship context, not just message content.\
\
Prior thread. If responding to an existing thread, provide the thread.\
\
Constraints and goals. Be explicit about what the email needs to accomplish.\
\
Verification Requirements\
\
All AI-generated email content requires review before sending:\
\
Accuracy check. Verify factual claims.\
\
Tone calibration. Read aloud. Does the tone match the relationship?\
\
Commitment review. Identify anything that could be read as a commitment.\
\
Recipient perspective. Read as the recipient would.\
\
Template Development\
\
For recurring email types, develop templates:\
\
Identify high-frequency patterns.\
\
Generate template with AI using variable markers.\
\
Refine through use.\
\
Store for reuse.\
\
Email-Specific Failure Modes\
\
Register mismatch. AI defaults to a register that doesn't match your\
\
relationship.\
\
Over-length. AI-generated emails often run longer than necessary.\
\
Hollow politeness. AI may include politeness phrases that read as insincere.\
\
Missing human judgment. AI cannot assess whether sending a particular\
\
email is wise.\
\
================================================================================\
\
SECTION 16: EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS\
\
================================================================================\
\
External communications extend beyond email to include client deliverables,\
\
stakeholder updates, public-facing content, and any material that represents\
\
you or your organization to outside parties.\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
16.1 Client Communications\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
Client communications include: formal deliverables, progress reports,\
\
meeting materials, and ongoing correspondence.\
\
Quality Thresholds\
\
Client-facing materials should meet higher quality standards:\
\
Elevated verification. Consider Tier 2 verification (cross-AI validation).\
\
Style consistency. Materials should match established professional voice.\
\
Error intolerance. Proofread beyond standard levels.\
\
Client-Specific Customization\
\
Adapt AI-generated content to client context:\
\
Relationship history. Provide context on long-term relationships.\
\
Client preferences. Specify preferences for detail, format, or tone.\
\
Political awareness. User must guide away from sensitive internal dynamics.\
\
Approval Workflows\
\
For significant client communications, implement approval workflow:\
\
Draft generation -> Internal review -> Quality verification ->\
\
Approval gate -> Send and archive.\
\
AI should not send client communications directly.\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
16.2 Stakeholder Communications\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
Stakeholder communications address parties with interest in your work\
\
beyond direct clients: partners, investors, regulators, media, public.\
\
Audience Analysis\
\
Stakeholder communications require audience-specific framing:\
\
Identify stakeholders. Who will read this?\
\
Tailored framing. Adjust for specific audience needs.\
\
Multi-audience considerations. Craft for the most sensitive audience.\
\
Risk Management\
\
Stakeholder communications carry elevated risk:\
\
Public record potential. Assume anything written may become public.\
\
Commitment scrutiny. Be precise about promises vs. aspirations.\
\
Regulatory awareness. User must verify compliance in regulated contexts.\
\
Media awareness. Ambiguities may be resolved against your interests.\
\
Consistency Management\
\
Across stakeholder communications, maintain consistency:\
\
Messaging alignment. Align with public statements.\
\
Position documentation. Document stated positions.\
\
Temporal consistency. Acknowledge changes in position rather than\
\
pretending continuity.\

\
17.2 Glossary\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
ALIGNMENT TURN\
\
The mandatory exchange at the start of every session where the AI generates\
\
a checklist of scope, materials, and workflow for user verification. Prevents\
\
evaporation and missing context. See Section 4.3.1.1.\
\
BOOTSTRAP\
\
A document capturing project state, decisions, and next actions for handoff\
\
to a new AI session. The primary vehicle for multi-session continuity.\
\
BRANCH STARTUP FILE\
\
A specialized context packet used to initialize a new branch workstream.\
\
Contains inherited project context, branch scope, and mini-rooting questions.\
\
See Section 12.3.3 and TPL-015.\
\
CEREMONY IS CONTINUITY\
\
The foundational principle< 2026/02/12 21:32:04.000358839  length=8192 from=34735 to=42926
 that formal artifact creation (bootstraps, logs,\
\
protocols) is not bureaucratic overhead but the mechanism that enables\
\
AI-assisted work to survive session boundaries. See Section 2.1.5.\
\
COGNITIVE DIVERGENCE\
\
A systematic departure between AI's understanding and user's intent that\
\
corrupts ongoing work. See Section 14.3.\
\
CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL\
\
The 6-step sequence (Stop, Flag, Explain, Propose, Await, Document) used\
\
when protocol behaviors conflict with project objectives. See Section 4.5.\
\
CONNECTOR TRANSPARENCY\
\
The protocol requiring AI to narrate all tool invocations (notebook queries,\
\
file reads) in the visible chat transcript to prevent context invisibility.\
\
See Section 4.4.\
\
DECISION LOG\
\
Cumulative record of decisions made across sessions, including rationale.\
\
FINDINGS REPORT\
\
A synthesis document capturing empirical discoveries organized by topic\
\
rather than chronology. Uses F-## indexing. See Section 5.6.\
\
HEADROOM OPPORTUNISM\
\
The strategic practice of utilizing remaining token capacity after primary\
\
objectives are complete to address secondary items, without compromising\
\
closeout quality. See Section 4.3.2.1.\
\
HUSK VS. COCONUT\
\
The filtering principle used at phase transitions. Husk is ephemeral\
\
context (to be left behind); Coconut is essential knowledge (to be carried\
\
forward). See Section 4.3.5.\
\
INSIGHT CAPTURE PROTOCOL\
\
The mechanism for documenting out-of-scope ideas that arise during active\
\
work without derailing the current session. Feeds the Backlog Register.\
\
See Section 5.9.7.\
\
NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY\
\
The deep context recovery layer using tools like NotebookLM to provide\
\
queryable access to the full project corpus. See Section 10.3.\
\
PHASE PROTOCOL\
\
A phase-stable governance document defining how the AI should behave\
\
during a specific project phase. Complements the Project Guide (what)\
\
and Bootstrap (where). See Section 5.2.\
\
PROJECT GUIDE\
\
The authoritative definition of project scope, objectives, and parameters.\
\
RESPONSE INDEXING\
\
The system of prefixing substantive AI responses with sequential IDs\
\
([1], [2]) to enable precise retrieval and referencing. See\
\
Section 4.3.1.2.\
\
ROOTING (PHASE 0)\
\
The deliberate process of establishing a project's foundation (Project\
\
Guide + Base Phase Protocol) before execution begins. See Section 2.5.1.\
\
SESSION FIDELITY REPORT (SFR)\
\
A structured assessment embedded in the Session Log evaluating objective\
\
achievement, phase progress, and handoff readiness. See Section 5.4.4.\
\
THREE-TIER DOCUMENTATION\
\
A pattern for managing complex documentation using Architecture References,\
\
Component References, and Changelogs. See Section 12.4.\

GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
...\
\
STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
\
- GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1.0.8.txt\
\
- TPL-001 Project Initiation Form\
\
...\
\
STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING PROCESS (PHASE 0)\
\
Send a message like:\
\
\"I'm rooting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the\
\
manual and TPL-001. Per Section 2.5.1, let's engage in collaborative project\
\
design to establish the Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol.\"\
\
STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN\
\
...\
\
STEP 5: REVIEW FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
\
After dialog, the AI will generate:\
\
1. The Project Guide (Strategic definition)\
\
2. The Base Phase Protocol (Behavioral governance)\
\
Review both. The Phase Protocol is critical...it tells the AI how to behave\
\
in future sessions.\
\
STEP 6: STORE AND BEGIN\
\
1. Store the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge.\
\
2. Verify the Bootstrap for the first execution session references it.\
\
3. Begin Phase 1.\
