Based on the source file provided (**Justinstillness:SITS Stripe.csv**), the data represents **incoming subscription payments** (revenue) to **SITS LLC** from various customers, rather than expense transactions paid to external vendors or merchants [1].

Because your query asks to list vendors and **exclude income deposits**, there are **no qualifying transactions** to report from this file. The dataset consists entirely of income deposits (sales) and associated status updates (refunds, failures) where **SITS LLC** is the merchant receiving funds.

*   **Merchant Name:** SITS LLC [1, 2]
*   **Role:** The entity receiving payment (Seller).
*   **Transaction Type:** Subscription creations and updates (Income) [1].

If your intent was to analyze the **customers** (the people paying SITS LLC) or to see the **total revenue** collected by SITS LLC, please let me know, and I can provide that breakdown. However, as an expense report excluding income, the list is empty.
