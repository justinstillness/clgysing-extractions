Here are the full texts for the new templates from Session D, updated with the TPL numbers TPL-015, TPL-016, and TPL-017 as requested.\
\
### **TPL-015: Branch Startup File**\
\
**Source:** Drafted in Session D (Session 036) [1].\
\
```text\
TPL-015: BRANCH STARTUP FILE\
\
Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-015\
Version: 1.0\
\
Purpose: Provides the context packet for initializing a new branch\
         workstream. Functions as a specialized Bootstrap for branch\
         creation, containing inherited project context, branch scope,\
         and mini-rooting questions to establish the branch's foundation.\
\
When to Use: When creating a new branch from a mainline session or\
             planning session.\
\
Cross-reference: Section 12.3 (Branch Management), Section 12.3.3\
                 (Branch Creation Process), TPL-002 (Bootstrap Template)\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
INSTRUCTIONS\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
Generate this Startup File in the mainline session when the decision to\
branch has been made. The file provides everything the new branch's AI\
instance needs to orient and begin work.\
\
The Startup File is a specialized derivative of the Bootstrap (TPL-002).\
It shares the Bootstrap's function ... context transfer to a new AI\
instance ... but is structured for branch initialization rather than\
session continuation. Key differences:\
\
- Includes mini-rooting questions (a Bootstrap assumes rooting is\
  already complete)\
- Specifies the relationship to the mainline (a Bootstrap assumes\
  continuity within a single workstream)\
- May specify Phase Protocol modifications (a Bootstrap references\
  the existing Phase Protocol as-is)\
\
WRITING PRINCIPLES:\
\
Write for an AI that has no memory of the parent project. Be explicit\
about what the branch inherits, what it does not, and what it needs to\
establish on its own. Include enough mainline context to orient, but\
not so much that it overwhelms the branch's specific scope.\
\
The user will provide this file to the branch AI along with this manual\
(if the branch AI needs AIPM framework orientation). The branch AI\
reviews the Startup File and conducts the mini-rooting cycle before\
beginning any substantive work.\
\
FILE NAMING:\
[###]_branch-startup_[branch-handle].txt\
Example: 001_branch-startup_SECRES.txt\
\
DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:\
The mainline AI generates this file when instructed: \"Generate a\
branch startup file for [purpose]\" or \"Spin up a branch for [scope].\"\

MINI-ROOTING QUESTIONS\
================================================================================\
\
[The branch AI should address these questions collaboratively with the\
user at the start of the first branch session. This is the abbreviated\
rooting cycle for branches.]\
\
1. SCOPE CONFIRMATION: The branch objectives above are [confirmed /\
   need adjustment]. Any refinements?\
\
2. MAINLINE CONNECTION: How tightly coupled is this branch to mainline\
   progress? Does the mainline depend on branch outputs, or can they\
   proceed independently?\
\
3. PHASE PROTOCOL REVIEW: Having reviewed the inherited Phase Protocol,\
   do any behaviors need modification for this branch's work? (e.g.,\
   different methodology, different output standards, different\
   coordination requirements)\
\
4. BRANCH STRUCTURE: Is this a single-phase branch (execute and\
   integrate) or multi-phase (requiring its own phase transitions)?\
\
5. CONVENTIONS CONFIRMATION: Will this branch use the same naming\
   conventions, file classes, and artifact templates as the mainline?\
   Any branch-specific conventions needed?\
\
================================================================================\
DYNAMIC STATE\
================================================================================\
\
Decision Log Continuity:\
- Last mainline decision: D-[###]\
- Branch decisions: Begin at D-[###]-BR-001 [or continue mainline\
  sequence ... specify approach]\
\
Response Index:\
- Branch response index: Starts at [2] [or continues mainline\
  sequence at [####] ... specify approach]\
\
Finding Index:\
- Last project finding: F-[##]\
- Branch findings: Continue project sequence at F-[##]\

### **TPL-016: Cross-Branch Awareness Document**\
\
**Source:** Drafted in Session D (Session 036) [22].\
\
```text\
TPL-016: CROSS-BRANCH AWARENESS DOCUMENT\
\
Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-016\
Version: 1.0\
\
Purpose: Provides a shared reference for projects with multiple active\
         branches. Ensures every session ... mainline or branch ... has\
         awareness of parallel workstreams without requiring full\
         context on each branch.\
\
When to Use: When a project has two or more active branches. Create\
             when the second branch is established; update at natural\
             checkpoints throughout the project.\
\
Where to Store: Project Knowledge (alongside Phase Protocol), so that\
                every session has access without explicit upload.\
\
Cross-reference: Section 12.3.7 (Cross-Branch Awareness Document),\
                 Section 12.3 (Branch Management)\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
INSTRUCTIONS\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
This document is a living reference maintained throughout a project's\
branching lifecycle. It is stored in Project Knowledge so that every\
AI instance ... mainline or branch ... can access it as part of the\
mandatory first action.\
\
UPDATE TRIGGERS:\
- A new branch is created\
- A branch completes, pauses, or is abandoned\
- Inter-branch dependencies change\
- An integration session occurs\
- Significant scope changes in any branch\
- Periodically during long-running parallel work (weekly recommended)\
\
WRITING PRINCIPLES:\
- Keep entries concise ... this is an awareness tool, not a comprehensive\
  record. 2-3 sentences per branch objective is sufficient.\
- Focus on what other sessions need to know, not branch-internal details\
- Flag coordination needs prominently ... these are the items most likely\
  to cause problems if missed\
\
FILE NAMING:\
[PROJECT]_cross-branch-awareness.txt\
Example: GOV-AIPM_cross-branch-awareness.txt\
\
This is a single file per project, updated in place (not versioned per\
session like bootstraps or session logs).\

### **TPL-017: Findings Report**\
\
**Source:** Drafted in Session D (Session 036) [36].\
\
```text\
TPL-017: FINDINGS REPORT\
\
Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-017\
Version: 1.0\
\
Purpose: Structured capture of empirical discoveries organized by topic.\
         Preserves observations, evidence, and implications in a format\
         designed for high queryability and evidence-to-decision tracing.\
\
When to Use: During or after sessions involving research, exploration,\
             evaluation, testing, or any work producing empirical\
             observations that warrant structured capture.\
\
Cross-reference: Section 5.6 (Findings Reports), Section 5.3 (Decision\
                 Logs), Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity)\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
INSTRUCTIONS\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
Complete a Findings Report when a session produces empirical discoveries\
that go beyond routine execution. The report captures what was observed,\
what evidence supports it, and what it means for the project.\
\
WHEN TO USE:\
- Research or exploration sessions\
- Evaluation, testing, or validation sessions\
- Field testing or beta testing sessions\
- Any session producing significant empirical observations\
\
WHEN NOT NEEDED:\
- Pure execution sessions (drafting, formatting, assembly)\
- Administrative sessions (file organization, project setup)\
- Sessions where no empirical observations emerged\
\
The AI may propose Findings Report generation mid-session when it\
recognizes a pattern of empirical discovery. The user approves, defers\
to closeout, or declines.\
\
INDEXING:\
Finding IDs (F-##) accumulate across the entire project and never\
reset. Check the prior Findings Report or Session Log for the last\
used F-## number. If this is the project's first Findings Report,\
begin at F-01.\
\
FILE NAMING:\
[###]_findings.txt or [###]_findings_[topic].txt\
Examples: 012_findings.txt, 032_findings_beta-test-review.txt\
\
DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:\
The AI generates this template as part of the session workflow. Say:\
\"Let's capture findings\" or \"Start a Findings Report\" to initiate.\
The AI may also propose generation proactively.\
\
Tips:\
- Write discoveries as standalone statements ... a reader should\
  understand each finding without additional context\
- Be specific in evidence ... reference sessions, response indexes,\
  or external sources\
- Separate observation (Discovery) from interpretation (Impact)\
- Use standard verdicts where they fit; create custom verdicts when\
  needed\
