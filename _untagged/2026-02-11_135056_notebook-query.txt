**Headroom Opportunism**

**Concept Definition**
**Headroom Opportunism** is the strategic practice of utilizing the remaining token capacity (context window) of an active AI session to execute secondary, exploratory, or backlog tasks after primary objectives are achieved, but before the session must be closed due to context degradation or token limits. It relies on **Headroom Management**, which involves assessing the "dynamic state" of the session...specifically the remaining context percentage...to determine if there is sufficient "headroom" to safely conduct additional work without compromising the quality of the mandatory closeout artifacts (Session Log, Findings Report, Bootstrap) [1], [2], [3].

**Example**
A clear example of Headroom Opportunism occurred during **Session 001**. The session was initially scoped for project planning and toolkit exploration. However, the session "exceeded initial scope through productive headroom utilization," allowing the team to document 5 multi-tool combination workflows and capture a 15-item exploration backlog, effectively pulling future work into the current session because the context window permitted it [1], [4], [5].

Another example occurred in **Session 013**, where the AI assessed that despite significant work, there was enough headroom to run **Test 7 (source_ids Cross-Notebook Bleed)**. This test was not part of the primary scope but was executed because the session had not yet reached the "token cliff," allowing for an immediate operational win before closeout [6], [7].

**Practice**
The practice of Headroom Opportunism follows a specific decision logic, typically executed towards the end of a session:

1.  **Headroom Assessment:** The AI estimates current context usage (e.g., "we're at roughly 60-65% context utilization") and response index continuity [8], [3].
2.  **Cost Estimation:** The AI calculates the token budget required for mandatory closeout tasks (generating Findings Reports, Session Logs, and Bootstraps), which effectively establishes a "hard floor" or safety margin that cannot be violated [9], [3].
3.  **Opportunity Selection:** If the remaining capacity exceeds the safety margin, the AI proposes "lightweight" or "high-priority" secondary tasks from the backlog (e.g., a single query test or drafting a specific protocol) [10], [3].
4.  **Execution or Deferral:**
    *   *Execute:* If safe, the task is run immediately (e.g., "Path A: Run Test 2c now") [11].
    *   *Defer:* If the margin is tight, the AI advises closing out to protect the integrity of the session records (e.g., "recommend we close out cleanly now rather than risk a compressed closeout") [3].

**Closeout Loose Ends Assessment**
The **Closeout Loose Ends Assessment** is the formal protocol step that immediately follows headroom decisions and precedes the generation of final session artifacts. It acts as a final quality control gate to ensure no critical data is lost before the context window is wiped.

The assessment explicitly checks the following categories [12], [13], [14]:
*   **Decisions Made:** Verifies that all agreements are captured as formal decisions (D-###).
*   **Scope Items:** Confirms which planned tasks were completed versus deferred.
*   **Artifacts:** Ensures all generated files (Reports, Specs, Logs) are accounted for and delivered.
*   **Handoff Context:** Identifies context that must be explicitly written into the Bootstrap for the next session (e.g., "Test 3 deferred to Session 011").
*   **User Actions:** Lists tasks the user must perform outside the AI session (e.g., uploading files to GitHub).
*   **Questions:** Confirms no unresolved queries remain that would block future work.
