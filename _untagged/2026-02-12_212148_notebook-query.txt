### PART VI: MAIL & EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS\
\
*(No changes from v1.0.7 baseline)*\
\
#### SECTION 15: EMAIL INTEGRATION\
\
**15.1 Email-to-AI Workflow**\
Email content frequently requires AI processing: summarization, response drafting, information extraction, or action item identification. This subsection addresses patterns for bringing email content into AI workflows [1, 2].\
\
*   **Ingestion:** Use direct paste for individual emails or batch processing for threads. Strip headers unless relevant [3].\
*   **Privacy:** Redact personal or confidential business data before processing [4].\
*   **Tasks:** Summarization, response drafting, and information extraction are primary use cases [5].\
\
**15.2 AI-to-Email Workflow**\
AI-generated email content requires careful handling before sending.\
*   **Context:** Provide relationship context (e.g., \"new client,\" \"long-term partner\") to shape tone [6].\
*   **Verification:** All AI-generated email content requires review for a< 2026/02/12 21:22:48.000244810  length=8192 from=16885 to=25076
ccuracy, tone calibration, and commitment review [7].\
*   **Failure Modes:** Watch for register mismatch (too formal/casual) and hollow politeness [8].\
\
#### SECTION 16: EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS\
\
**16.1 Client Communications**\
Client communications include formal deliverables, progress reports, and meeting materials.\
*   **Quality:** Consider Tier 2 verification (cross-AI validation) for significant deliverables [9].\
*   **Approval:** AI should generate content; humans must approve and send. This gate is non-negotiable [10].\
\
**16.2 Stakeholder Communications**\
Stakeholder communications address partners, investors, regulators, and the public.\
*   **Risk:** Assume public record potential. Be precise about promises vs. aspirations [11].\
*   **Consistency:** Messaging should align with public statements and prior positions [12].\

\
#### 17.2 Glossary\
\
*(Expanded with v1.0.8 terminology)*\
\
**ALIGNMENT TURN**\
The mandatory exchange at the start of a continuation session where the AI generates a checklist of scope, materials, and workflow for user verification before substantive work begins [25, 26].\
\
**BOOTSTRAP**\
A handoff document generated at the end of each session capturing state, decisions, and next actions. It tells the next AI instance *where* the project left off [27, 28].\
\
**BRANCH STARTUP FILE**\
A specialized context packet used to initialize a new branch workstream. It functions as a bootstrap for branch creation, containing inherited project context and mini-rooting questions [29, 30].\
\
**CEREMONY IS CONTINUITY**\
The philosophy that formal artifact creation (logs, bootstraps, protocols) is not bureaucratic overhead but the essential mechanism that enables memory and continuity in AI-assisted work [31, 32].\
\
**CONNECTOR TRANSPARENCY PROTOCOL (CTP)**\
The requirement that AI narrate all external tool interactions (notebook queries, file reads) in the chat transcript to ensure auditability and context recovery [33, 34].\
\
**FINDINGS REPORT**\
A synthesis document that captures empirical discoveries organized by topic (F-##), distinct from chronological session logs or decision logs [35, 36].\
\
**HEADROOM OPPORTUNISM**\
The strategic practice of utilizing remaining token capacity after primary objectives are met to complete secondary tasks without compromising closeout quality [37, 38].\
\
**HUSK VS. COCONUT**\
The filtering principle used during phase transitions: *Husk* (ephemeral conversation, rejected options) is discarded; *Coconut* (decisions, validated findings, final outputs) is carried forward [39, 40].\
\
**INSIGHT CAPTURE PROTOCOL**\
A mechanism for documenting out-of-scope ideas that arise during execution without disrupting the current session, feeding the Backlog Register [41, 42].\
\
**NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY**\
The use of external retrieval tools (like NotebookLM) to provide deep context recovery by querying the accumulated project corpus [43, 44].\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL**\
A phase-stable governance document defining *how* the AI should behave during a specific project phase. It sits between the Project Guide and Bootstrap [45, 46].\
\
**RESPONSE INDEXING**\
The practice of prefixing substantive AI responses with a sequential ID (e.g., `[47]`) to enable precise retrieval and referencing across session transcripts [48, 49].\
\
**ROOTING (PHASE 0)**\
The formal initiation phase of a project dedicated to establishing the Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol before execution begins [50, 51].\
\
**SESSION FIDELITY REPORT (SFR)**\
A structured assessment embedded in the Session Log that evaluates objective achievement, phase progress, and handoff readiness [52, 53].\

\
### APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE\
\
*(Updated for Rooting/Phase 0 Alignment)*\
\
**STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (Updated Workflow)**\
\
**STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES**\
You need the Manual and **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form**.\
\
**STEP 2: INITIATE ROOTING (PHASE 0)**\
Start a new chat. Upload files. Say:\
*\"I am starting a new project. Per Section 2.5.1, let's begin the Rooting process. Help me define the Project Guide and establish the Base Phase Protocol before we start execution.\"* [50]\
\
**STEP 3: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN**\
Engage in dialog. The AI will help you define:\
*   Objectives and Deliverables\
*   Phase Structure (The Sine Wave Model) [78]\
*   Behavioral requirements (for the Phase Protocol) [27]\
\
**STEP 4: OUTPUT GENERATION**\
The AI will generate:\
1.  **Project Guide** (What we are building)\
2.  **Base Phase Protocol** (How we will work)\
3.  **Bootstrap** (For the first execution session) [79]\
\
**STEP 5: EXECUTION**\
Start a *new* chat for Session 001. Upload the Bootstrap.\
*   The AI will review the Phase Protocol as its first action.\
*   You are now in execution mode.\
