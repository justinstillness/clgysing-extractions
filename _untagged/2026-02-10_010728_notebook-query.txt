Based on the provided sources, the detailed session logs correspond to the **NLMINTA** (NotebookLM Integration) project branch, which is a sub-project of **CLGYSING** (Cultology Singles). While the sources do not contain the full transcripts for the original CLGYSING sessions 001...005, the \"Master WIP Inventory\" provides a reconstruction of the work accomplished in those early parent sessions.\
\
The following description details the **NLMINTA branch sessions 001 through 005**, followed by the reconstructed history of the original CLGYSING foundation.\
\
### **NLMINTA Sessions 001...005: Branch Rooting and Tool Exploration**\
\
The NLMINTA project was established to integrate Claude...s MCP capabilities with NotebookLM to automate and enhance the CLGYSING research extraction process.\
\
#### **Session 001: Foundation & Toolkit Mapping**\
*   **Objective:** Establish the NLMINTA project and map the NotebookLM MCP toolkit.\
*   **Key Activities:**\
    *   **Project Orientation:** Established NLMINTA as a branch of CLGYSING [1].\
    *   **Toolkit Survey:** Cataloged 29 available tools (e.g., `notebook_query`, `studio_create`) and mapped them to LibForge use cases [2], [3].\
    *   **Testing:** Performed initial live tests on the CLGYSING notebook (15 sources), validating structural surveys and deep dives [2].\
*   **Outcomes:** Produced the *Tool Capability x LibForge Use Case Matrix* and the *Exploration Backlog* [4]. Designed 5 multi-tool workflow< 2026/02/10 01:09:02.000090404  length=4965 from=8513 to=13477
s [5].\
\
#### **Session 002: Systematic Capability Verification**\
*   **Objective:** Validate high-priority tools for the extraction methodology.\
*   **Key Activities:**\
    *   **Calibration Testing:** Ran \"Omniological Approach\" queries against a benchmark repository to test fidelity [6].\
    *   **Cross-Corpus Synthesis:** Tested a 4-pass query strategy to answer complex research questions (Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic knowledge) across 14 source packages [7].\
    *   **Pipeline Discovery:** Identified a **Two-Mode Pipeline**: Mode 1 (Extraction/Organization) and Mode 2 (Creative Synthesis) [8], [9].\
*   **Key Finding:** Discovered that extraction fidelity (NotebookLM layer) is high, but synthesis errors (Claude layer) can introduce terminology conflation [10], [11].\
\
#### **Session 003: Strategic Pipeline & Studio Validation**\
*   **Objective:** Validate report generation tools and source filtering.\
*   **Key Activities:**\
    *   **Source Isolation:** Confirmed that the `source_ids` parameter is **mandatory** for isolating content; natural language prompts alone failed to filter sources [12].\
    *   **Report Generation:** Tested `studio_create` with structured prompts (\"Create Your Own\"). Found that structured prompts achieved 100% capture rates on structured sources [13], [14].\
    *   **Pipeline Architecture:** Articulated the **Three-Stage Over-Capture Pipeline**: (1) Broad AI Extraction, (2) Semantic Survey via NotebookLM, (3) Master Crystallization [15].\
*   **Outcomes:** Established operational protocols for polling `studio_status` due to API lag [16].\
\
#### **Session 004: Limits Verification & Protocol Planning**\
*   **Objective:** Finalize tool validation and plan Phase 2.\
*   **Key Activities:**\
    *   **Full Lifecycle Test:** Validated the complete notebook lifecycle (create ... add source ... query ... delete) [17].\
    *   **Context Steering:** Discovered that **Notes** created in a notebook can steer AI responses (e.g., injecting an analytical framework as a note) [18].\
    *   **Filesystem Boundary:** Confirmed that Claude cannot directly access files on the EC2 server; established `export_artifact` to Google Drive as the preferred bridge [19], [20].\
*   **Outcomes:** Validated 13 new tools. Established that `research_start` enables programmatic notebook building [21].\
\
#### **Session 005: LibForge Research & Integration Mapping**\
*   **Objective:** Deep dive into LibForge research to map tools to workflows.\
*   **Events:**\
    *   **Crash Recovery:** This session experienced technical instability/crashes [22].\
    *   **Retroactive Documentation:** Because Session 004 did not produce a findings report due to issues, Session 005 generated the retroactive *004_FINDINGS* report and updated the *Exploration Backlog* [23], [24].\
    *   **Infrastructure Update:** Documented the discovery of Google Drive as a bidirectional file interface, eliminating the need for a separate EC2 filesystem [25].\
    *   **Transition:** Prepared for the \"State of the Art\" overview in Session 006 [26].\

### **Original CLGYSING Rooting & Sequence (Reconstructed)**\
\
While the logs provided are for NLMINTA, the **Master WIP Inventory** [27] allows for a reconstruction of the original CLGYSING project's early sessions (001...005).\
\
#### **Rooting Process & Phase Protocol**\
*   **Rooting:** The CLGYSING project appears to have been \"rooted\" in **Session 001**. The NLMINTA logs reference an existing `v1.2_PP_CLGYSING-PHASE_1_Base-Protocol` [28], indicating the Phase Protocol was created prior to the NLMINTA branch.\
*   **Sequence:** The \"Master WIP Inventory\" indicates a heavy \"Bottom-Up\" drafting phase occurred immediately:\
    *   **Sessions 001...002:** These sessions were dedicated to drafting the core Work-In-Progress (WIP) files for the system's foundation.\
    *   **Items Created:**\
        *   *WIP 01:* Pre-Extraction Coherence Scan [27].\
        *   *WIP 02:* Extraction Process (Three-pass protocol) [29].\
        *   *WIP 03:* Relationship Registry [29].\
        *   *WIP 04:* Card Entry Process [29].\
        *   *WIP 05:* Indexing & Maintenance [29].\
        *   *WIP 06:* Storyboarding Guide [30].\
        *   *WIP 07:* Provenance Files [30].\
        *   *WIP 08:* ArgBlock Composition [30].\
        *   *WIP 09:* ICR (Interim Concept Repository) [30].\
\
#### **Preparing for Phase 1**\
Phase 1 of CLGYSING (\"Material Inventory & Methodology Development\") was prepared by establishing these 9 core WIPs in Sessions 001...002. This laid the \"Bottom-Up\" foundation (Extraction/Repository) [31], which was necessary before moving to the \"Bridge\" layer (ArgBlocks/Terminology) in later sessions (007...008) [32], [33]. The NLMINTA branch was then launched to explore automating these very processes using NotebookLM.
