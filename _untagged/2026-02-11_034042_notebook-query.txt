================================================================================

Based on the provided sources, I cannot summarize Findings F74 through F79 from Session 014 because the source materials end at **Session 013** (Finding F73).

However, I can confirm from the **Session 013** documentation that **Session 014** was planned to focus on **threading optimization** and methodological consolidation.

### Context from Available Sources (Session 013)
*   **Current Status:** The last recorded finding is **F73** (Session 013), which confirmed that the Pre-Extraction Evaluation (PE) pass successfully characterizes raw conversational corpora [1].
*   **Planned Scope for Session 014:** The bootstrap generated at the end of Session 013 explicitly targeted **"threading optimization"** as a primary objective [2].
*   **Threading Optimization Matrix (Planned):** This test was designed in Session 013 as a **2x2 matrix** to test conversation threading behavior [3]:
    *   **Variables:** Simple vs. Complex concepts .. Threaded (conversation_id reuse) vs. Unthreaded (fresh context).
    *   **Goal:** Determine if threading improves depth accumulation or causes redundancy.
*   **Source_IDs Cross-Notebook Bleed (Planned):** This refers to **Test 7** (Cross-notebook query bleed), which was scoped in Session 012 [4] and deferred to Session 014. It aims to determine if filtering a query to a single source ID within a multi-source notebook prevents "bleed-through" or noise from other sources in that notebook.

**To provide the summary for F74...F79, please upload the "014_session-log" or "P2_FINDINGS_Session-014" file.**
