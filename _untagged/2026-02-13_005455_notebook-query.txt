Based on the drafting sources for **GOV-AIPM v1.0.8**, the Findings Report template (currently designated TPL-0XX in the draft files but matching the structure you described for TPL-017) is available.\
\
Here is the complete full text of the **Findings Report** template, including the specific fields for discovery, evidence, impact, verdict, and the cumulative index.\
\
***\
\
### **TPL-0XX: FINDINGS REPORT**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX (Draft)\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Structured capture of empirical discoveries organized by topic. Preserves observations, evidence, and implications in a format designed for high queryability and evidence-to-decision tracing.\
**When to Use:** During or after sessions involving research, exploration, evaluation, testing, or any work producing empirical observations that warrant structured capture.\
**Cross-reference:** Section 5.6 (Findings Reports), Section 5.3 (Decision Logs), Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity)\
\
---\
\
### **INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
Complete a Findings Report when a session produces empirical discoveries that go beyond routine execution. The report captures what was observed, what evidence supports it, and what it means for the project.\
\
**WHEN TO USE:**\
*   Research or exploration sessions\
*   Evaluation, testing, or validation sessions\
*   Field testing or beta testing sessions\
*   Any session producing significant empirical observations\
\
**INDEXING:**\
Finding IDs (**F-##**) accumulate across the entire project and never reset. Check the prior Findings Report or Session Log for the last used F-## number. If this is the project's first Findings Report, begin at F-01.\
\
**FILE NAMING:**\
`[###]_findings.txt` or `[###]_findings_[topic].txt`\
*Examples:*< 2026/02/13 00:55:24.000176680  length=4369 from=8693 to=13061
 `012_findings.txt`, `032_findings_beta-test-review.txt`\
\
**TIPS:**\
*   Write discoveries as standalone statements ... a reader should understand each finding without additional context.\
*   Be specific in evidence ... reference sessions, response indexes, or external sources.\
*   Separate observation (Discovery) from interpretation (Impact).\
*   Use standard verdicts where they fit; create custom verdicts when needed.\

\
### **FINDINGS REPORT TEMPLATE**\
\
**FINDINGS REPORT ... Session [###]**\
\
**File Class:** FINDINGS\
**Project:** [Project Name (Brief Description)]\
**Session:** [### Project-Code (Session Purpose)]\
**Date:** [Date]\
**Session Type:** [Phase Name ... Activity Type]\
**Finding Range:** F-[##] through F-[##]\
\
#### **REPORT CONTEXT**\
*[Brief description of the research, exploration, or testing activity that produced these findings. What was being investigated and why? 2-4 sentences providing enough context for a reader encountering this report independently.]*\
\
---\
\
#### **FINDINGS**\
\
**F-[##]**\
**Discovery:**\
*[Concise statement of the observation or insight. Specific enough to stand alone. 1-3 sentences.]*\
\
**Evidence:**\
*[Specific data points, test results, source references, or observations that support the discovery. Reference sessions, response indexes, or external sources as appropriate.]*\
\
**Impact / Implication:**\
*[How this finding affects the project ... its pipeline, methodology, deliverables, or thesis. What changes or should change because of this discovery?]*\
\
**Status / Verdict:**\
*[VALIDATED | GAP IDENTIFIED | REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING | CONTRADICTS | INFORMS DECISION | NOTED | or custom verdict]*\
\
---\
\
**F-[##]**\
**Discovery:**\
*[...]*\
\
**Evidence:**\
*[...]*\
\
**Impact / Implication:**\
*[...]*\
\
**Status / Verdict:**\
*[...]*\
\
*[Continue for each finding]*\
\
---\
\
#### **CUMULATIVE FINDINGS INDEX**\
*[Running index of ALL findings across the project, not just this report. Update this section with each new Findings Report.]*\
\
| Finding ID | Discovery (brief) | Session | Status |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| F-01 | [One-line summary] | [###] | [Verdict] |\
| F-02 | [One-line summary] | [###] | [Verdict] |\
| ... | ... | ... | ... |\
| F-[##] | [One-line summary] | [###] | [Verdict] |\
\
**Total findings to date:** [#]\
\
---\
\
#### **PROVENANCE**\
**Research Method:** *[How discoveries were made ... testing, comparative analysis, field observation, literature review, etc.]*\
**Sources Consulted:** *[Notebooks queried, documents reviewed, tools tested]*\
**Sessions Spanned:** *[If findings draw from multiple sessions, list them]*\
**Related Decisions:** *[Any D-### decisions that these findings informed or were informed by]*\
\
---\
\
### **TEMPLATE NOTES**\
\
**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\
The template prioritizes queryability. Each finding is a self-contained block with a unique ID, making it highly effective as a notebook source. A query for \"F-14\" or \"findings about token exhaustion\" returns precisely structured results.\
\
**THE FIVE-FIELD SCHEMA:**\
*   **Discovery** and **Evidence** are empirical (what was seen).\
*   **Impact/Implication** is analytical (what it means).\
*   **Status/Verdict** is evaluative (what to do about it).\
\
**STANDARD VERDICTS:**\
*   **VALIDATED:** Confirms an approach, tool, or hypothesis.\
*   **GAP IDENTIFIED:** Reveals a missing capability or content.\
*   **REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING:** Promising but inconclusive.\
*   **CONTRADICTS:** Contradicts a prior assumption or approach.\
*   **INFORMS DECISION:** Provides evidence for a pending choice.\
*   **NOTED:** Recorded for reference, no immediate action.\
\
**CUMULATIVE INDEX:**\
For long-running projects, the cumulative index may be maintained as a separate standalone file (`[PROJECT]_cumulative-findings-index.txt`) to avoid excessive growth within individual reports.\
\
**RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ARTIFACTS:**\
*   **TPL-005 (Session Log):** Notes findings generated during the session.\
*   **Decision Log:** Findings inform decisions. The \"Related Decisions\" field creates bidirectional traceability.\
