Based on the provided sources, here are the explanations for the principles and models you requested regarding the LibForge and NLMINTA workflows.\
\
### **1. The Husk vs. Coconut Principle**\
This principle is a filtering metaphor used during the **Extraction Process** (specifically within the \"Three-Stage Over-Capture Pipeline\") to distinguish between valuable core content and disposable meta-commentary.\
\
*   **Coconuts (Core Content):** These are the target concepts, theoretical frameworks, and arguments required for the repository (e.g., \"Parasitic Modality,\" \"Ontological Singularity\").\
*   **Husks (Meta-Content):** These are operational, biographical, or logistical details found in the source text that should generally be filtered out or segregated. Examples include \"subscriber relations,\" \"publishing timelines,\" \"patience framed as investment,\" or \"feedback invitations\" [1].\
\
In the extraction pipeline, \"husks\" are often identified during **Gap Detection (GD)** passes or specific **Vocabulary Extraction (VX)** passes, where operational data is separated from the theoretical framework [2, 3]. The goal is to ensure the final Concept Repository contains only the \"meat\" (coconut) while operational context (husk) is either discarded or routed to a separate log [1].\
\
### **2. The Sine Wave Model for Phase Transitions**\
*Note: The specific phrase \"Sine Wave Model\" does not appear in the provided text sources.*\
\
However, the sources detail a specific **Phase Transition Protocol** involving an **8-step sequence** designed to manage the shift between project phases (e.g., moving from Extraction to Thesis Architecture) [4]. Key elements of this transition that mirror a cyclical or wave-like process include:\
\
1.  **Assess Readiness:** Determining if the current phase is complete [4].\
2.  **Husk Removal:** Discarding obsolete context (the \"husk\") to ensure the next phase starts with a clean context window [5].\
3.  **Bootstrap Prep:** Generating a new bootstrap file to seed the next session with only the necessary state [4].\
\
### **3. The Alignment Turn at Session Start**\
The \"Alignment Turn\" is a standardized \"Mandatory First Action\" [6] and governance protocol used at the beginning of every session to ensure the AI agent is synchronized with the user's intent and project constraints before work begins. It involves:\
\
*   **Protocol Confirmation:** The AI must review the \"Phase Protocol\" and explicitly confirm adherence to behavioral requirements (e.g., \"Phase Protocol confirmed\") [6].\
*   **Bootstrap Review:** The AI absorbs the \"Bootstrap\" file, which dictates the current session's objective, cycle position, and < 2026/02/10 01:09:49.000272509  length=2457 from=46573 to=49029
required file uploads [7].\
*   **Alignment Checklist:** The AI presents a checklist summarizing the session scope, required materials, workflow steps, and known gaps. The user must confirm this alignment before the AI executes any tasks [8-10].\
*   **Explicit Alignment:** This enforces \"Epistemic Humility,\" ensuring the AI acts as a \"Junior Associate\" rather than an oracle, validating assumptions before acting [5, 11].\
\
### **4. Headroom Opportunism**\
This concept refers to the strategic utilization of remaining **token budget (headroom)** at the end of a session to perform high-value, secondary tasks without endangering the primary session artifacts.\
\
*   **Mechanism:** As a session progresses, the AI monitors \"Headroom Management\" (estimated token usage vs. limit) [12].\
*   **Opportunistic Execution:** If the primary objectives (e.g., defining a tool matrix) are met and sufficient tokens remain, the session expands organically to include \"secondary items\" or \"wishlist\" testing [13, 14].\
*   **Example:** In Session 001, the session \"exceeded initial scope through productive headroom utilization,\" allowing for unplanned toolkit mapping and infrastructure analysis [15, 16]. Conversely, if headroom is low, the protocol dictates an \"emergency exit\" to generate closeout artifacts immediately to prevent data loss [17].\
\
### **5. Ceremony as Continuity**\
\"Ceremony\" refers to the formal, ritualized creation of artifacts and protocols that ensure project state persists across the \"amnesia\" of independent AI sessions. Because the AI resets every session, these ceremonies create a **\"Phase-Stable Boundary\"** [18].\
\
Key ceremonial elements include:\
*   **The Bootstrap:** A standardized \"handoff\" document generated at the end of one session to \"boot\" the next. It contains the dynamic state, decision logs, and backlog [7].\
*   **Session Fidelity Report (SFR):** A closing ceremony where the AI reports on its own performance, fidelity metrics, and unresolved items, ensuring nothing is lost between sessions [19].\
*   **Session Logs:** The canonical record of work accomplished, decisions made (D-###), and issues encountered [4, 16].\
\
These artifacts are not just administrative; they are the \"continuity system\" that allows a multi-session project to function as a coherent whole [18].
