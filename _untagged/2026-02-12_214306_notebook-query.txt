Based on the **Master Assembly Blueprint** and the **Drafting Plan**, here are the remaining integration points (IPs) for **Volume 6** (Sections 15...17 and Appendices) that have not yet been applied.

### Remaining Integration Points for Volume 6

These IPs are explicitly scheduled for the Volume 6 assembly session (Session 043/044):

*   **E-IP7 (Phase Protocol Template Verification):** Targets **Appendix A**. This involves verifying that the Layer 1 behaviors listed in the *Phase Protocol Template* (TPL-0XX) match the final specifications drafted in Session E (specifically Conflict Resolution and Instruction Chain Interpretation).
*   **A-IP8 (Table of Contents Update):** Targets the **Master TOC** (to be finalized in Volume 6). This reflects the renumbering of Section 5 and the insertion of new sections throughout the manual.
*   **E-IP8 (TOC Additions):** Targets the **Master TOC**. Adds entries for *3.8 Instruction Chain Interpretation* and *4.5 Conflict Resolution Protocol*.
*   **F-IP7 (TOC Additions):** Targets the **Master TOC**. Adds the entry for *12.4 Three-Tier Documentation Architecture*.

### IPs Targeting Sections 15, 16, and 17

*   **Sections 15 (Email Integration) & 16 (External Communications):**
    *   There are **no integration points** targeting these sections. They remain **unchanged** from v1.0.7.

*   **Section 17 (Reference):**
    *   **No specific "IP" number** targets Section 17, but the **Drafting Plan** assigns the following scope to the Volume 6 assembly:
        *   **17.2 Glossary:** Add new terms defined in v1.0.8 (e.g., *Phase Protocol, Rooting, Branch Startup File, Session Fidelity Report, Headroom Opportunism*).
        *   **17.3 Index:** Comprehensive update to reflect new content locations.

### IPs Targeting Appendices

*   **Appendix A (Template Reference):**
    *   **E-IP7** (described above).
    *   **Scope Task:** Assign final TPL numbers to the 9 new templates (Project Initiation revision, Phase Protocol, Findings Report, etc.) and integrate them into the appendix.
*   **Appendix E (Version History):**
    *   **Scope Task:** Add the v1.0.8-DRAFT entry documenting the "Phase 6c" integration.
*   **Appendix G (Artifact Taxonomy):**
    *   **Scope Task:** Add the new artifacts (*Phase Protocol, Findings Report, Branch Startup File*, etc.) to the taxonomy.
*   **Appendix H (Quick Start Guide):**
    *   **Scope Task:** Update to reflect the "Rooting as Phase 0" methodology.
