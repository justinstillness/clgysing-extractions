Here is the complete, verbatim text of Section 3.1 from the v1.0.7 baseline manual:

3.1 THE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM IN PRACTICE

-------------------------------------

Every AI interaction involves three mental models:

1. What you think you know and want

2. What the AI understands from your input

3. What the AI assumes to fill gaps

Misalignment between these models produces errors. Some errors are obvious

and immediately correctable. Others are subtle...the AI proceeds confidently

in the wrong direction, producing outputs that look correct but rest on

flawed premises.

The Explicit Alignment Principle addresses this: reduce the gap between

models through deliberate, structured over-communication. [1]
