Based on the provided sources, specifically the findings from the CLGYSING and NLMINTA sessions, here is the breakdown of known behavioral issues, required prompts, the new notepad system, and housekeeping protocols.\
\
### 1. Known Issues with Claude/AI Forgetting & Behaviors\
Even with phase protocols in place, several specific behavioral failure modes have been identified, particularly regarding extraction fidelity and context management.\
\
*   **External Knowledge Contamination (The \"Phantom\" Concept):** A critical failure mode where the AI draws from broader project knowledge or its training data rather than the specific source package provided.\
    *   *Example:* In Session 007, the extraction process hallucinated the \"BITE Model\" into a source package where it was not present, because the AI knew the broader Cultology framework used that model [1, 2].\
    *   *Root Cause:* The AI prioritized \"helpfulness\" and logical inference over strict source boundary enforcement [3].\
*   **Synthesis Layer Degradation:** While the extraction layer (NotebookLM) usually maintains high fidelity, the synthesis layer (Claude) can introduce categorical errors during multi-query synthesis, such as conflating correlated terms into synonyms (e.g., conflating \"Symbiotic Path\" with \"Intrinsic Path\") [4, 5].\
*   **Compression Drift:** When creating compressed notations of concepts, AIs (Gemini and Grok specifically) tend to \"drift\" by pulling in context from outside the specific quote being compressed to make the entry more readable. This violates the provenance rule that the notation must derive *only* from the quote [6, 7].\
*   **Fabricated Quotes:** In one test, Claude substituted a fabricated quote for actual content to fit a concept definition, contaminating the \"Original Quote\" field which is supposed to be the anchor of truth [8, 9].\
*   **Context Invisibility (The Transcript Gap):** When using MCP tools (like NotebookLM), the user cannot see the raw tool output in the chat transcript. If the session context compacts or crashes before the AI manually saves the data, that data is permanently lost [10, 11].\
\
### 2. Required User Reminders & Startup Prompts\
To mitigate these issues, specific prompts and structural constraints must be applied at session start and during extraction tasks.\
\
*   **Mandatory Phase Protocol Review:** The first action of < 2026/02/10 17:33:59.000263486  length=3125 from=10159 to=13283
every session must be the AI reviewing the AIPM Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge and explicitly confirming adherence [12, 13].\
*   **Strict Source Boundary Enforcement:** Prompts must explicitly state an \"IRONCLAD RULE\": Extract *only* from the specific source provided. Do not draw from project knowledge, memory, or inference [14].\
*   **Structural Separation in Prompts:** To prevent \"Sequencing Collapse\" (where the AI confuses instructions with source text), prompts must use heavy delimiters (e.g., `****** STOP - READ INSTRUCTIONS ******`) to physically separate instructions from source material [15].\
*   **\"Fifth-Grader\" vs. Proprietary Rule:** Instructions must clarify that common knowledge (understandable by a 5th grader) can be compressed, but proprietary jargon or unique phrasing must be quoted verbatim or bracketed [16, 17].\
\
### 3. The New Chat Notepad System (SeraphRecorder)\
The \"manual\" note-taking method (asking the AI to save query results to a NotebookLM note) was deemed too token-expensive and unreliable due to truncation [10, 18]. It has been replaced by an automated pipeline.\
\
*   **SeraphRecorder:** This is a middleware system running on the MCP server. It automatically captures every request and response between Claude and NotebookLM [19, 20].\
*   **Signal Strings:** To organize this captured data, the user (or Claude) appends a metadata tag to every query.\
    *   *Format:* `[SERAPH: PROJECT=clgysing, PASS=TX, NUM=01...]` [21].\
    *   *Function:* This tag tells the system how to route, name, and store the file in the GitHub repository (Chronicler) automatically [21, 22].\
*   **Chronicler:** This is the tool that allows Claude to interact with the saved files in the GitHub repository, enabling the retrieval of past extractions without relying on chat memory [23].\
\
### 4. User Housekeeping (Pre-Session & Post-Session)\
The integration of NotebookLM has added specific maintenance tasks to the standard AIPM workflow.\
\
**Pre-Session Housekeeping:**\
*   **Source ID Verification:** Source IDs in NotebookLM can change if the notebook is modified. The user/AI must verify source IDs via `notebook_get` at the start of a session to prevent \"silent failure\" (empty query results) [24, 25].\
*   **Context Loading via Query:** Instead of uploading massive transcripts, the AI should query the \"NLMINTA Sessions\" notebook (which acts as project memory) to retrieve findings or context from previous sessions [26].\
\
**Post-Session Housekeeping:**\
*   **Upload to NotebookLM:** The user must upload the generated Session Log and Findings Report to the designated \"NLMINTA Sessions\" notebook. This ensures the \"Project Memory\" remains up to date for future queries [26, 27].\
*   **Artifact Verification:** Verify that any SeraphRecorder captures (tagged files) successfully landed in the repository [28].\
*   **Standard AIPM Artifacts:** Generate the Session Fidelity Report (SFR), Decision Log, and Bootstrap for the next session [29].
