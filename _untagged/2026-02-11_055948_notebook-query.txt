Based on the `HA Suite Development Wishlist v1.0` and current architecture references, here is the status of pending maintenance, high-priority items, and the Conductor service plans.

### **1. Pending Maintenance & High-Priority Wishlist Items**

The **HA Suite Development Wishlist v1.0** [1] consolidates all pending tasks.

*   **High-Priority Items:** The documentation explicitly flags the following as the top priorities for development:
    *   **W-100 (Conductor Foundation):** Establishing the base service for automation orchestration [1].
    *   **W-101 (NLM Registry):** Auto-refresh capability for the notebook registry [1].
    *   **W-102 (Query Data Reporter):** Automated reporting on query data [1].
    *   **W-042 (jacob-bd Backup):** Creating a backup mechanism for the Majeston installation before updates [1].

*   **jacob-bd Update (W-043):**
    *   An update to the `jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli` package is tracked as item **W-043** in the Infrastructure section [1].
    *   The current installed version is **v0.2.15** [2].
    *   *Note:* The wishlist also prioritizes **W-042 (Backup)** to ensure safety before applying this update [1].

*   **Google Auth Token Refresh:**
    *   This is a standing **manual maintenance procedure**, not a code wishlist item.
    *   **Cycle:** Tokens must be refreshed every **10...14 days** [3].
    *   **Method:** This requires a Mac with Chrome to run `nlm login` followed by the `refresh-tokens.sh` script to push credentials to the EC2 instance [3].
    *   **Related Wishlist Item:** The wishlist *does* contain **W-040 (PAT Rotation)** [1], but this refers to rotating the GitHub Personal Access Tokens shared by Caliper and Chronicler, not the Google/Majeston tokens.

### **2. State of Conductor Service Plans**

**Conductor** is the planned "NLM automation orchestration service" designed to sit on top of the current tools [1].

*   **Architectural Decision (D-038):** Conductor will be built as an **independent service**, rather than modifying the existing Majeston tool [1]. This preserves the stability of the core research tool while adding automation layers.
*   **Planned Capabilities:**
    *   **W-100:** Foundation service (Priority) [1].
    *   **W-101:** Registry auto-refresh (Priority) [1].
    *   **W-102:** Query data reporter (Priority) [1].
    *   **W-103:** Theme saturation automation [1].
    *   **W-104:** Batch extraction orchestrator [1].
    *   **W-105:** Path B direct NLM API access [1].

Conductor represents the next major phase of development, shifting focus from manual query tools to automated "saturation" and extraction workflows.
