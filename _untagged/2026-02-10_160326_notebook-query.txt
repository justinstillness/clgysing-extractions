Based on the session history, here is the status of the File Browser basic auth issue:

**1. Current Status**
The File Browser is deployed at `https://justinstillness.com/files/` but remains **inaccessible** due to a persistent basic authentication loop [1]. It was formally logged as the top priority "Open Item Carrying Forward" at the end of Session 022.

**2. Last Troubleshooting Step Attempted**
No technical fix was applied yet.
*   **Action:** You reported the issue during the deployment phase of Session 022.
*   **Diagnosis:** I identified it as a likely Caddy configuration error (hash format mismatch, route ordering, or username sensitivity) [2].
*   **Next Step:** I provided a prompt for you to feed into **Claude Code** on the EC2 instance to auto-diagnose the `Caddyfile`: *"The file browser is deployed but I'm stuck in a basic auth loop... Please check the Caddyfile auth configuration."*
*   **Result:** You decided to defer this troubleshooting to a fresh session due to context window limits ("Check headroom... We should close out and start fresh") [3].

**3. Exact Auth Loop Behavior**
You described the behavior as: *"I put the password and user name in a few times, copy pasted so I know it's correct. It just keeps asking for it again and again"* [4]. This indicates the server is rejecting the credentials (likely due to a bcrypt hash mismatch in the Caddyfile) or the browser is not sending them correctly, causing Caddy to continuously return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
