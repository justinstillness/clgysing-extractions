Here is the complete full text of the **TPL-010 Project Roadmap** template as defined in the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.7-DRAFT** manual [1][2].\

\
### TPL-010: PROJECT ROADMAP\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-010\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Provides macro-level project visibility and phase-specific execution planning; serves as the \"horizon view\" document for maintaining orientation across multi-phase projects\
**When to Use:**\
*   < 2026/02/13 00:21:27.000672666  length=6952 from=10159 to=17110
At project initiation (create initial roadmap)\
*   At phase transitions (update status, generate new phase detail)\
*   After extended absence (reference for re-orientation)\
*   When strategic visibility is needed mid-phase\
\
---\
\
#### INSTRUCTIONS\
\
The Project Roadmap serves two functions:\
1.  **MACRO VIEW (Horizon):** Shows the full project arc...where you've been, where you are, where you're going. Updated at each phase transition.\
2.  **PHASE VIEW (Execution Brief):** Details the current phase...objectives, expected work, success criteria. Regenerated at each phase boundary.\
\
**Creating the Roadmap:**\
*   Generate initial roadmap after completing Project Initiation (TPL-001)\
*   The AI should draft the roadmap based on the Project Guide's phase structure\
*   Review and confirm the roadmap before beginning Phase 1 work\
\
**Maintaining the Roadmap:**\
*   The AI maintains and updates this document as part of its coordinator role\
*   At phase transitions, the AI marks prior phase complete and generates new Current Phase Detail\
*   Users should save updated roadmaps to project files after each transition\
\
**Tips:**\
*   The roadmap is not a rigid plan...phases may shift as projects evolve\
*   When phase structure changes significantly, update the Project Guide first, then regenerate the roadmap\
*   Keep the Current Phase Detail focused; detailed task tracking belongs in session bootstraps\
\
**Dialog Completion Option:**\
This template can be completed through dialog with the AI. Say: *\"Help me complete TPL-010\"* or *\"Walk me through Project Roadmap\"*\
