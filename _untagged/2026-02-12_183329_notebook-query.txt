Based on the **Assembly Blueprint** (Source `GOV-AIPM_v1_0_8_Assembly-Blueprint.txt`), here is the status of Integration Points (IPs) for Sections 7 through 11:

**Integration Points Targeting Sections 7 through 11 (Volume 4)**
*   **None.** The Assembly Blueprint explicitly states regarding Volume 4: **"Integration Points: None directly targeting these sections."**

**Remaining IPs for Volume 4**
*   **None.** There are no formal Integration Points (A-IP, D-IP, E-IP, or F-IP) assigned to Volume 4.

**Context on Volume 4 Content:**
While there are no cross-reference "Integration Points," Volume 4 involves the following actions during assembly:
*   **Section 10.3 (Retrieval and Query Tools):** Applies a major revision using the draft file `DRAFT_Section_10-3_Notebook-Connectivity.txt`.
*   **User Behavior Callout:** Applies **Callout 8 (NotebookLM Maintenance)** to Section 10.3.
*   **Sections 7, 8, 9, and 11:** Remain **unchanged** from version 1.0.7.
