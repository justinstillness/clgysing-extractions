The **AI Operations Manual (GOV-AIPM)** is currently in **Version 1.0.7-DRAFT**, dated December 28, 2025, and is in the **Phase 6b Review and Validation** stage [1].

### **Current State and Structure**

The manual is organized into **six primary parts**, followed by reference sections and eight appendices [2, 3].

**Major Structural Components:**
*   **Part I: Foundations:** Covers purpose, core philosophy, and alignment principles [2, 4].
*   **Part II: Project Management:** Details project architecture, token management, session lifecycles, and canonical artifacts [5, 6].
*   **Part III: Governance Integration:** Explains the governance stack, resolution drafting, and SOP development [7, 8].
*   **Part IV: Tools & Formats:** Discusses AI role separation, adjunct tools, and file formatting [8, 9].
*   **Part V: Advanced Patterns:** Covers extended context, specialized use cases (research, creative, technical), and failure modes [9, 10].
*   **Part VI: Mail & External Communications:** Addresses email integration and external stakeholder communications [10].
*   **Appendices (A...H):** Includes templates, the Golden Prompt Library, tool configurations, troubleshooting, version history, failure mode catalogs, taxonomies, and a Quick Start Guide [3].

### **The Three Cycles Framework (Section 2.5)**

The **Three Cycles of AI-Assisted Work** provide a mental map for navigating the system, distinguishing between different temporal scales of operation. Each cycle has distinct concerns, tools, and potential failure modes [11].

**1. Project Lifecycle (Macro Cycle)**
*   **Scope:** The strategic level spanning days to months, covering the entire arc from conception to completion [12].
*   **Key Question:** "Where is this project in its overall journey?" [13].
*   **Phases:** Pre-AI Planning, Project Definition, Execution Phases, and Completion [13, 14].
*   **Primary Artifacts:** Project Initiation Form (TPL-001), Re-Entry Checklist (TPL-007), and Project Roadmap (TPL-010) [15].

**2. Session Lifecycle (Meso Cycle)**
*   **Scope:** The tactical level spanning minutes to hours...what happens each time you sit down to work [16].
*   **Key Question:** "What do I need to do before, during, and after this session?" [16].
*   **Phases:** Preparation, Initiation (establishing context), Active Work, and Closeout (generating bootstraps and logs) [16, 17].
*   **Primary Artifacts:** Bootstrap (TPL-002), Session Closeout Checklist (TPL-003), Session Log (TPL-005) [18].

**3. Interaction Cycle (Micro Cycle)**
*   **Scope:** The operational rhythm of back-and-forth dialogue, spanning seconds to minutes [19].
*   **Key Question:** "How do I work effectively with AI moment to moment?" [19].
*   **Phases:** Prompt Formulation, AI Response, Verification, and Adjustment [20].
*   **Primary Tools:** Failure Recovery Worksheet (TPL-009) and the Golden Prompt Library [21].

**The Parallel Support Track**
The framework also defines a **Parallel Support Track** for essential work that occurs outside the AI environment to enable success within it. This includes file management, cross-AI validation, weekly reviews, and tool maintenance [22].
