================================================================================

The Session Fidelity Report (SFR) is a governance and continuity artifact within the LibForge/AIPM framework (specifically Master List Items 22 and 23) designed to ensure project integrity across multi-session AI interactions [1], [2]. Its primary purpose is to capture decisions, identify gaps, log fidelity metrics, and prepare the \"bootstrap\" for the next session [3].\
\
The SFR is typically generated at the end of a session (\"Closeout Phase\") and is often embedded directly within the **Session Log** file, though it can be a standalone document for complex assessments [4], [5].\
\
### Structure and Fields\
\
Based on the Governance & Continuity specifications and actual session logs, the standard SFR includes the following sections and fields:\
\
**1. Header Information**\
*   **Status:** Draft or Complete.\
*   **Project:** The active project branch (e.g., NLMINTA).\
\
**2. Key Milestones Achieved**\
A checklist of specific tasks or objectives completed during the session.\
*   *Format:* Bulleted list with checkboxes [6].\
\
**3. Decisions Crystallized**\
Formal decisions made during the session that need to be preserved in the Decision Log.\
*   *Content:* Decision IDs (D-###) or descriptions of binding choices made regarding methodology or infrastructure [6].\
\
**4. Gaps & Insights Identified**\
*   **Gaps:** Missing information, failed tests, or unverified assumptions (e.g., \"Custom prompt effectiveness unknown\") [7].\
*   **Key Insights:** Discoveries made during execution (e.g., \"notebook_query produces high-quality... output\") [7].\
\
**5. Handoff Status**\
Critical context transfer for the next session/AI instance.\
*   **Context Carried Forward:** Assets or knowledge established in this session that must persist.\
*   **Required for Next Session:** Specific files or inputs needed to resume work.\
*   **Risks/Warnings:** Potential failure modes (e.g., \"Session numbering error\") [8], [9].\
\
**6. Next Session Projection**\
*   **Focus:** The primary objective for the subsequent session.\
*   **Success Criteria:** What constitutes a finished job for the next session.\
*   **Estimated Complexity:** (Low/Medium/High) to help with token management [9], [10].\
\
**7. Verification**\
*   **User Verification:** Placeholder for the user to confirm the AI's assessment (PENDING/CONFIRMED) [10].\

### Example Content\
\
The following example is reconstructed from **Session 001 (Planning & Toolkit Exploration)** and **Session 011 (Validation Analysis)** to demonstrate both standard reporting and analytical depth.\

N FIDELITY REPORT ... EMBEDDED**\
\
**Status:** DRAFT\
**Project:** NLMINTA (NotebookLM Integration)\
\
**Key Milestones Achieved:**\
[...] Notebook landscape surveyed (85 notebooks)\
[...] CLGYSING notebook tested with structural + targeted queries\
[...] All 29 tools documented with capabilities and use cases\
[...] Tool combination workflows designed (5 workflows)\
[...] Exploration backlog captured (~15 items) [6]\
\
**DECISIONS CRYSTALLIZED:**\
*   **D-001:** Validated \"Hybrid Architecture\" for concept extraction (routing synthesis to context field rather than suppressing it) [11].\
*   **D-029:** Adopted \"Pass Separation Principle\" (distinct queries for vocabulary vs. concepts vs. thesis strings) [12].\
\
**GAPS & INSIGHTS IDENTIFIED:**\
*   **Gaps:**\
    *   Custom prompt effectiveness unknown (research needed) [7].\
    *   Chat persistence failed (MCP queries do not appear in NLM chat history) [13].\
*   **Key Insights:**\
    *   `notebook_query` produces high-quality, terminology-preserving output [7].\
    *   `source_get_content` enables hybrid approach: NotebookLM identifies content, Claude extracts raw text [8].\
    *   **Severity Assessment:** The quote truncation in Gemini's output was a fidelity gap but \"not catastrophic\" because the architecture itself held; it is a localized failure with a preventive fix [14], [15].\
\
**HANDOFF STATUS:**\
*   **Context Carried Forward:** Complete toolkit documentation in Tool Matrix; Validation findings F41-F48 [8], [16].\
*   **Required for Next Session:** Tool Matrix document; Package 03 source file for re-extraction [8], [17].\
*   **Risks/Warnings:** Status polling has lag; `studio_status` returns \"in_progress\" for minutes after actual completion [18].\
\
**NEXT SESSION PROJECTION:**\
*   **Focus:** Systematic testing of high-priority untested tools (`chat_configure`, `studio_create`) [9].\
*   **Success Criteria:** `chat_configure` custom prompt tested and character limit verified [9].\
*   **Estimated Complexity:** MEDIUM [10].\
\
**VERIFICATION:**\
*   **User Verification:** PENDING [10].\
\
---\
\
### Variations\
\
*   **Midpoint Assessment:** In testing phases (like the \"Alpha Test Execution\"), the SFR may be generated mid-stream to capture \"severity ratings,\" \"catastrophic vs. recoverable verdicts,\" and \"project-impact framing\" regarding specific failures (e.g., assessing Gemini or Grok extraction errors) [5].\
*   **Integration:** The SFR is often integrated into the **Session Log** file rather than existing as a standalone file, unless the session is extremely complex [4].
