Based on the revision mandates in the **Drafting Plan** [1] and the content established in the **Section 2.5.1 (Rooting)** [2] and **TPL-001** [3] drafts, here is the full text of the updated **Appendix H: Quick Start Guide** for v1.0.8.\
\
This update incorporates the \"Rooting as Phase 0\" protocol, the creation of the Phase Protocol document, and the new session initiation standards.\
\

\
### APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE (v1.0.8-DRAFT)\
\
**Version:** 1.0.8-DRAFT\
**Date:** February 2026\
\
This appendix contains the complete Quick Start Guide for new users. It has been updated to reflect the **Rooting (Phase 0)** protocol and the **Phase Protocol** governance system.\

\
# GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
## WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-< 2026/02/12 21:43:51.000207104  length=6196 from=8693 to=14888
assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide takes you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"Phase 0 Complete\" in your first project.\
\
---\
\
## BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
### READINESS CHECK\
Before initiating a formal project, you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   **If answers are clear** ... Proceed to \"Phase 0: Rooting Your First Project\"\
*   **If answers are unclear** ... Start with an **Exploration Session** (upload the manual and ask the AI to help you explore your idea until these questions can be answered).\
\
---\
\
## PHASE 0: ROOTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT\
\
Every project begins with **Rooting** (Phase 0). This is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation *before* execution begins.\
\
**The Goal:** Produce two authoritative documents:\
1.  **Project Guide:** Defines *what* the project is (scope, objectives, roadmap).\
2.  **Phase Protocol:** Defines *how* the AI should behave (methodology, formatting, rules).\
\
### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
You need two files:\
1.  **GOV-AIPM Manual** (this document)\
2.  **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form** (from Appendix A)\
\
*Note: You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. A blank or partial form is fine. The AI will help you complete it through dialog.*\
\
### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and TPL-001. Let's begin **Phase 0 (Rooting)**.\
>\
> Please review the inputs and engage in collaborative project design. I expect you to probe my assumptions, challenge vague criteria, and help me structure the phases before we finalize the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN\
This dialog IS the work. It is not overhead. Expect 10...20 exchanges where the AI probes your thinking.\
\
**What the AI will do:**\
*   Ask clarifying questions about your objective (\"What specific outcome are you targeting?\")\
*   Surface assumptions (\"Are there stakeholders we haven't listed?\")\
*   Probe scope boundaries (\"Is updating the old policy in-scope or out-of-scope?\")\
*   Propose phase structures (\"This looks like a 3-phase project: Research, Drafting, Review.\")\
\
**What you should do:**\
*   Answer thoughtfully.\
*   Push back if the AI misunderstands (\"No, that's not what I meant.\").\
*   Be honest about uncertainty (\"I don't know yet; let's leave that open.\").\
\
### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
After the dialog, the AI will draft two documents. Review them carefully:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Does this accurately define *what* we are building?\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Does this accurately define *how* the AI should behave? (e.g., \"Always use Python for data tasks,\" \"Never summarize without citations.\")\
\
Iterate until both are correct. These are your project's constitution.\
\
### STEP 6: PHASE 0 CLOSURE & SETUP\
When the documents are right, say:\
> \"These capture my intent. Phase 0 is complete. Please generate the **Bootstrap** for Phase 1, Session 1.\"\
\
**USER ACTION ... POST-ROOTING SETUP:**\
1.  **Download** the Project Guide, Phase Protocol, and Bootstrap.\
2.  **Store** the Phase Protocol in your AI's **Project Knowledge** (or equivalent persistent memory).\
3.  **Save** the Project Guide and Bootstrap in your project folder.\
\
---\
\
## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT: EXECUTION (Phase 1)\
\
Now that you have rooted the project, you are ready to execute.\
\
### STARTING SESSION 1 (and all future sessions):\
1.  **New Chat:** Open a fresh chat (ensure Phase Protocol is in Project Knowledge).\
2.  **Upload:** Upload the **Bootstrap** file (TPL-002) generated at the end of the previous session.\
3.  **Prompt:** \"Starting Phase 1, Session 1. Bootstrap attached. Please review the Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge as your mandatory first action.\"\
\
### THE AI'S DUTIES:\
*   **Protocol Review:** The AI will confirm it has read the Phase Protocol and understands its behavioral instructions.\
*   **Alignment Turn:** The AI will present an **Alignment Checklist** (Scope, Materials, Workflow).\
*   **Execution:** Once you confirm alignment, work begins.\
\
### SESSION CLOSEOUT:\
*   **Never just close the tab.**\
*   When work is done, say **\"Close out.\"**\
*   The AI will generate a **Session Log** (what happened) and a **Bootstrap** (for the next session).\
*   Save these files. They are your continuity link to the next session.\
\
---\
\
## KEY CONCEPTS SUMMARY\
\
*   **ROOTING (Phase 0):** The design phase. Don't rush it. If rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions. It saves 100 sessions of rework later.\
*   **PHASE PROTOCOL:** The \"Constitution.\" Tells the AI *how* to behave (formatting, tone, rules). Stored in Project Knowledge.\
*   **PROJECT GUIDE:** The \"Map.\" Tells the AI *what* the project is (scope, deliverables).\
*   **BOOTSTRAP:** The \"Baton.\" Handed from one session to the next. Tells the AI where we left off.\
*   **CEREMONY IS CONTINUITY:** Producing these artifacts isn't bureaucracy; it's the only way to prevent the AI (and you) from forgetting the project state.
