**Session 047 Quality Check: Volume 6a**

I have reviewed `GOV-AIPM_v1_0_8_Volume-6a_Communications-Reference-Templates.txt` against the drafting specifications, integration points, and formatting standards.

**Status:** **PASSED** (with one minor glossary note for Final Assembly).

### 1. Structural & Formatting Verification
*   **File Format:** Clean TXT format with proper box-drawing characters (e.g., TPL-001 tables) and standard headers. No markdown artifacts detected.
*   **Segmentation:** Volume 6a cleanly contains **Sections 15...17** and **Appendix A (Part 1)**.
*   **Boundary:** The file ends after TPL-006, with a clear note [1] indicating Volume 6b continues with the remaining templates. This matches the segmentation plan.

### 2. Template Completeness (Part 1)
Volume 6a correctly includes 9 templates (Core & Ongoing Management):
*   **Revised (v2.0):** TPL-001, TPL-002, TPL-003, TPL-005.
*   **New (v1.0):** TPL-012 (Alignment Checklist), TPL-013 (Phase Protocol), TPL-014 (PP Addendum). *TPL numbers successfully assigned.*
*   **Unchanged:** TPL-004, TPL-006.
*   *Note:* TPL-010 (Project Roadmap) and TPL-017 (Findings Report) are listed in the TOC [2] but correctly deferred to Volume 6b per the split.

### 3. Integration Point Verification
*   **E-IP7 (Phase Protocol Verification):** Verified. TPL-013 [3] correctly includes the **Conflict Resolution** (A.7) and **Instruction Chain** (A.8) protocols exactly as drafted in Session E.
*   **F-IP7 (TOC Updates):** The Volume 6a TOC [2] correctly reflects the new template list.

### 4. Glossary Check (Section 17.2)
*   **Present:** 19 new/revised terms included (e.g., "Ceremony is Continuity," "Headroom Opportunism," "Connector Transparency," "Rooting").
*   **Missing:** "Loose Ends Assessment" and "Response Index Register" were flagged in Session B drafts [4] [5] as needed entries but are absent from the current glossary text.
    *   *Recommendation:* Add these two terms during **Session 051 (Final Assembly)** when consolidating the master glossary. They do not require regenerating Volume 6a.

**Next Step:** Proceed to **Session 048** to assemble **Volume 6b** (Remaining Templates: TPL-007 through TPL-023) and **Volume 6c** (Appendices B...H).
