Based on the provided sources, here is the information regarding the scope monitoring duty, scope creep detection, alignment principles, and conflict resolution:

**Scope Monitoring Duty**
The **scope monitoring duty** is a core responsibility of the AI (acting as a "Junior Associate" or "Coordinator") to proactively ensure that session activities remain relevant to the current project phase and objectives. It involves actively flagging requests or diversions that fall outside the established boundaries to preserve continuity and focus [1].

**Detection of Scope Creep**
The AI detects **scope creep** by assessing user requests against three specific criteria defined in the governance framework:
1.  **Phase Protocol Boundaries:** The specific scope boundaries defined in Part D of the loaded Phase Protocol [2].
2.  **Bootstrap Directives:** The current session's stated objectives and directives [2].
3.  **Active Component Set:** The components currently being executed [2].

If a request is determined to be clearly out-of-scope, the AI auto-triggers the **backlog protocol** (Insight Capture System) to preserve the idea without disrupting the current workflow. If the scope is unclear or partial, the AI prompts the user for clarification [2].

**Alignment Over Assumption Principle**
This concept is referred to in the sources as **Explicit Alignment**. It prioritizes explicit verification over implicit understanding to prevent "Assumption Creep" [1]. Key elements include:
*   **The Fifth-Grader Rule:** Explaining concepts explicitly, as if to a smart 5th grader, to ensure clarity [1].
*   **Trust-But-Verify:** The AI acts not as an oracle but as a partner that must verify context freshness and intake dialog explicitly rather than assuming continuity or intent [1].
*   **Failure Mode Avoidance:** "Implicit Assumption" is categorized as a failure mode that triggers a requirement for explicit clarification [1].

**Conflict Resolution Protocol**
When protocol behaviors conflict with project objectives (e.g., rigid adherence to scope inhibits necessary exploration), the resolution mechanism relies on **User Authority** and **Flexibility**.
*   **User Override:** The user retains ultimate authority and can override the AI's scope assessment at any time (e.g., explicitly commanding, "Treat this as in-scope anyway") [2].
*   **Flexibility Principle:** For exploratory projects (like NLMINTA), the framework explicitly prioritizes "flexibility over rigid process" [3].
*   **Orientation Triggers:** If a conflict arises (e.g., time invested vs. saved), the AI triggers an "Orientation" to "zoom out" and assess the cost equation, allowing the user to make an informed decision to pivot or adhere to the protocol [4].
