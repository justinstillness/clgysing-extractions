The exact tool call name is **`Chronicler:flush_pipeline`**.

### **Parameters**
It takes **no parameters**.
*   **Format:** `Chronicler:flush_pipeline()`
*   **Function:** Triggers an on-demand extraction and GitHub push of SeraphRecorder data by running `git pull --rebase`, `extract.py --all`, and `push-to-github.sh` on the server [1].

### **Errors/Issues in Sessions 023 & 024**
Yes, issues were reported, primarily related to **tool discovery and visibility** rather than code failure:

*   **Session 023:** The tool was built and deployed during this session. However, Claude was unable to call it because the MCP tool manifest is cached at the start of a conversation. Since `flush_pipeline` was added *after* the session began, it was not visible to Claude [2]. The underlying logic was verified manually via the command line [3], but the tool call itself failed due to this caching issue [4].
*   **Session 024:** While explicit failure logs for this tool aren't detailed in the Session 024 excerpts, the user later reported in Session 025 that `Chronicler:flush_pipeline` "didn't work," prompting a troubleshooting item for Session 026 to verify if the tool name was correct or if the tool registration persisted [5], [6].
