Here is the full text of TPL-009 Failure Recovery Worksheet from version 1.0.7 of the manual.\
\
**TPL-009: FAILURE RECOVERY WORKSHEET**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-009\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Structured response when a failure case is identified; guides recovery and captures lessons learned\
**When to Use:** When recognizing signs of a failure case from the AI Operations Manual Appendix A (or similar operational failure)\
\
---\
\
**INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
Use this worksheet when you recognize that you've entered a failure case. The worksheet guides you through stopping, assessing, recovering, and learning from the failure.\
\
**Failure cases covered:**\
1. No Logs ... Decision Churn\
2. SOP Drift\
3. Unchecked AI Assumptions\
4. No Branching ... Token Collapse\
5. Cognitive Fatigue\
6. No Re-Entry Protocol ... Regression\
7. Cognitive Divergence (AI not tracking user intent)\
\
**General Recovery Principle:**\
STOP ... DOCUMENT current state ... STEP BACK to last known-good position ... PROCEED with explicit acknowledgment of what was lost or uncertain\
\
**Tips:**\
- Don't continue working while completing this worksheet\
- Be honest about severity...underestimating delays recovery\
- The lessons learned section is not optional; failures should improve process\
- Some context loss may be unrecoverable; acknowledge and move forward\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
This template can be completed through dialog with the AI. Say:\
\"Help me complete TPL-009\" or \"Walk me through Failure Recovery\"\
\
See Section 3.5 for the Dialog Intake System.\

\
**FAILURE TYPE:**\
\
[ ] **NO LOGS ... DECISION CHURN**\
Re-debating settled issues; contradictory directions; no record of why decisions were made\
\
[ ] **SOP DRIFT**\
Actual practice has diverged from documented procedures; doing things differently than specified\

AI output seems confident but feels \"off\"; contradicts known facts; accepted without verification\
\
[ ] **NO BRANCHING ... TOKEN COLLAPSE**\
Chat sluggish; AI losing early context; output quality degrading; approaching or exceeding token limits\
\
[ ] **COGNITIVE FATIGUE**\
Declining decision quality; irritability; taking shortcuts; reduced attention to detail\
\

\
**4. FAILURE-SPECIFIC RECOVERY PROTOCOL**\
\
Select the protocol matching your failure type:\
\
**PROTOCOL A: NO LOGS ... DECISION CHURN**\
[ ] STOP making new decisions\
[ ] Reconstruct decision history:\
    - Review chat transcripts\
    - Check any partial logs\
    - Interview memory (what do you remember deciding?)\
    - Document reconstructed decisions with [RECONSTRUCTED] tag\
[ ] Create decision log going forward:\
    - Use Template 4 (Decision Log Entry)\
    - Log all new decisions immediately\
[ ] Accept some history may be unrecoverable:\
    - Document what's unknown\
    - Make fresh decisions where needed\
    - Note: \"Decision made due to unrecoverable history\"\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL B: SOP DRIFT**\
[ ] STOP current work\
[ ] Conduct SOP audit:\
    - Compare documented procedure to actual practice\
    - Identify specific divergences\
    - Assess which approach is actually correct\
[ ] Decide resolution path:\
    [ ] Update SOP to match reality (practice is better)\
    [ ] Retrain to match SOP (procedure is better)\
    [ ] Hybrid (some of each)\
[ ] Document the decision:\
    - Log rationale for resolution\
    - Update relevant documents\
    - Communicate changes if others affected\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL C: UNCHECKED AI ASSUMPTIONS**\
[ ] PAUSE accepting AI outputs\
[ ] Explicitly surface assumptions:\
    - Ask AI: \"What assumptions are you making?\"\
    - List assumptions you've been making\
    - Identify which are verified vs. assumed\
[ ] Cross-validate:\
    - Use second AI source (Tier 2 validation)\
    - Check against primary sources\
    - Query NotebookLM against governing documents\
[ ] Re-evaluate affected outputs:\
    - Which outputs were based on unchecked assumptions?\
    - Do they need revision?\
    - What verification is needed going forward?\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL D: NO BRANCHING ... TOKEN COLLAPSE**\
[ ] STOP new drafting immediately\
[ ] Generate emergency bootstrap:\
    - Capture current state NOW before more context is lost\
    - Use Template 2 (Bootstrap Template)\
    - Be comprehensive...you may be losing context as you write\
[ ] Save all files immediately:\
    - Download/e< 2026/02/12 23:34:56.000347356  length=7913 from=25077 to=32989
xport everything produced\
    - Don't rely on chat history\
[ ] Accept some context loss:\
    - Document what you remember\
    - Note what seems uncertain\
    - Previous chat may be unreliable for details\
[ ] Resume in fresh chat:\
    - Create new chat with tighter scope\
    - Provide bootstrap and essential files\
    - Verify AI understanding before proceeding\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL E: COGNITIVE FATIGUE**\
[ ] STOP decision-making immediately\
[ ] Take mandatory break:\
    - Minimum 30 minutes\
    - Step away from screen\
    - Do not make significant decisions\
[ ] Assess state after break:\
    - Am I actually recovered?\
    - What's my capacity for the rest of day?\
    - Should I stop for the day?\
[ ] Review recent decisions:\
    - Look at decisions made while fatigued\
    - Flag any that seem questionable\
    - Consider re-evaluation when fresh\
[ ] Resume with fresh review:\
    - Start next session with current state review\
    - Explicitly verify recent decisions\
    - Reduce workload if needed\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL F: NO RE-ENTRY PROTOCOL ... REGRESSION**\
[ ] STOP new work immediately\
[ ] Execute full re-entry protocol:\
    - Use Template 7 (Re-Entry Checklist)\
    - Do not skip steps\
[ ] Audit work done since return:\
    - What have I produced since returning?\
    - Does it contradict earlier work?\
    - Is it reinventing existing solutions?\
[ ] Reconcile contradictions:\
    - Identify conflicts between old and new work\
    - Determine correct resolution\
    - Document the reconciliation\
[ ] Do not proceed until oriented:\
    - Complete re-entry checklist fully\
    - Verify with reorientation chat\
    - Confirm understanding before new work\
\
Notes:\
_____________________________________________________________________________\
\
**PROTOCOL G: COGNITIVE DIVERGENCE**\
[ ] STOP current task immediately\
[ ] Document the divergence:\
    - State your intended logic path clearly\
    - Note AI's actual execution path\
    - Identify the specific point where paths diverged\
[ ] Use QA-001 prompt (Cognitive Divergence Audit):\
    - Provide AI with intended logic and misaligned outputs\
    - Request analysis of where logic branched\
    - Get explicit correction path\
[ ] If QA-001 fails to correct:\
    - Consider fresh chat with clean context\
    - Use different AI tool for the task\
    - Escalate to Tier 3 (human review) if critical\
[ ] Prevent recurrence:\
    - Add explicit checkpoints for this task type\
    - Consider whether bootstrap or instructions need clarification\
    - Log pattern for future reference\
