Based on the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.7-DRAFT** manual and the **032 Revision Findings** document provided in the sources, here is the current state of Section 4 and its relation to the specific concepts you asked about:\
\
### **Current Content of Section 4 (v1.0.7)**\
In the current manual (v1.0.7), **Section 4** is titled **\"Project Architecture & Token Management.\"** It covers three main areas:\
*   **4.1 Chat Architecture:** Defines chat types (Root, Branch, Execution), relationships between them, and naming conventions.\
*   **4.2 Token Management:** Covers token economics, **Headroom Discipline**, token-efficient practices, warning signs of context exhaustion, and recovery protocols.\
*   **4.3 Session Lifecycle:** Defines the workflow for Initiation, Active Management, Closeout, Emergency Exit, and Phase Transitions.\
\
### **Detail Level of Specific Components**\
*   **Session Initiation (4.3.1):** **Moderate Detail.** It provides brief checklists for three scenarios (New Projects, Continuation via Bootstrap, and Branch Sessions). It focuses on steps like \"Provide bootstrap\" and \"Confirm understanding\" but lacks the strict \"Alignment Turn\" protocol found in later findings.\
*   **Session Closeout (4.3.3):** **Moderate Detail.** It provides a 7-step checklist (e.g., save deliverables, generate bootstrap, update session log). It emphasizes discipline but does not yet include the \"loose ends assessment\" or explicit user-initiation triggers found in the v1.0.8 revision plan.\
*   **Phase Transition (4.3.5):** **High Detail.** This is the most robust part of the lifecycle section in v1.0.7. It includes six subsections covering how to recognize boundaries, specific upload requirements (Project Guide, Roadmap), token considerations (including segmentation strategies), AI responsibilities, user responsibilities, and the \"Horizon View\" concept.\
\
### **Does it mention...?**\
\
| Concept | Status in v1.0.7 (Section 4) | Notes from Revision Findings (for v1.0.8) |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| **Alignment Turns** | **No** | Section 4.3.1 mentions verifying understanding, but the formal **\"Alignment Turn\"** (a mandatory checklist at session start) is identified as a **new requirement** in the 032 findings to prevent \"session evaporation.\" |\
| **Response Indexing** | **No** | The manual mentions naming conventions for files and chats, but the specific **Response Indexing System** (e.g., `[1] | Semantic Title`) is listed as a **refinement** to be added in the next version. |\
| **Headroom Management** | **Yes** | Section 4.2.2 is titled **\"Headroom Discipline.\"** It explicitly discusses assessing headroom before substantial work. However, the specific concept of **\"Headroom Opportunism\"** (proactively suggesting secondary tasks) is a new finding for v1.0.8. |\
| **Session Fidelity Reports** | **No** | Section 5.3 covers **Session Logs**, but the specific **Session Fidelity Report (SFR)**...embedded within the log to verify context transfer...is identified as a **new artifact** in the 032 findings. |\
\
**Summary:**\
Section 4 currently provides the structural \"skeleton\" for session management (Initiation, Active, Closeout) and extensive guidance on Token/Headroom management. However, the specific *protocols* that enforce rigor...**Alignment Turns**, **Response Indexing**, and **Session Fidelity Reports**...are operational refinements derived from field testing (Sessions 020...032) and are slated for inclusion in the **v1.0.8** update; they do not exist in the v1.0.7 text.
