Based on the provided session logs and architecture references, here is the session folder workflow, local organization structure, transcript management process, and naming conventions for the AWSNBLM project.\
\
### 1. Session Folder Workflow\
The workflow follows a cyclical \"Bootstrap ... Execute ... Closeout\" pattern designed to maintain context across disjointed chat sessions.\
\
*   **Initiation:** A new session is started by uploading the **Bootstrap** file generated at the end of the previous session, along with the previous **Session Log**. This provides the AI with immediate context on current state, deferred items, and next steps [1][2].\
*   **Execution:** Work is performed (coding, deployment, documentation). If new tools or configurations are built, they are documented.\
*   **Closeout:** At the end of the session, the AI generates specific \"Closeout Artifacts\" for the user to download [3][4]:\
    *   **Session Log:** A record of decisions, completed items, and outputs.\
    *   **Bootstrap:** A context file for the *next* session (containing project status, active tasks, and required file uploads).\
    *   **Documentation/Specs:** Updated architecture or tool references (e.g., `v3.1_SPEC...`).\
*   **Archival:** The user downloads these artifacts to their local iCloud folders [5].\
\
### 2. Local Artifact Organization\
The user organizes files locally on a Mac, specifically within iCloud Drive to facilitate access across devices (Mac and iPhone/Termius).\
\
*   **Root Directory:** `.../AI Files/Cultology/Notebook LM Claude Integration/` [6][7].\
*   **Maintenance & Scripts:** A dedicated folder containing maintenance scripts (`health-check.sh`, `refresh-tokens.sh`) and the maintenance README.\
    *   *Note:* This folder name has a known **trailing space**: `Notebook LM Claude Integration (Maintenance ORG Folder) /` [8][9].\
*   **Tool-Specific Folders:** Specific tools have their own subdirectories, such as:\
    *   `.../AWSNBLM MCP Tools (named tools I build)/Caliper v1.0.../` [10].\
*   **Keys:** A dedicated folder for security keys: `.../pem EC2 file/` [6].\
\
### 3. Transcript Download and Storage\
Transcripts are treated as a knowledge base for the project.\
\
*   **Export:** Transcripts are exported from the chat interface (referenced as \"Claude-XXX...md\" files) [11][12].\
*   **Storage (Knowledge Base):** The user uploads these transcripts to a specific **NotebookLM notebook** named **\"AWSNBLM Session Transcripts\"** (ID: `78ccac4a...`) [13][14].\
*   **Retrieval:** The AI can query this notebook via the Majeston MCP tool to retrieve historical context, past decisions, or specific configurations from previous sessions, effectively acting as \"adjunct project knowledge\" [15][16].\
\
### 4. Naming Conventions\
The project uses strict naming conventions to distinguish file types and ensure version control.\
\
**Session Artifacts:**\
*   **Session Logs:** `[Session#]_session-log_[Topic].txt` (e.g., `020_session-log_(Pipeline-Failure-Resilience).txt`) [17].\
*   **Bootstraps:** `[NextSession#]_bootstrap_[Topic].txt` (e.g., `021_bootstrap_(Pipeline-Docs-and-Deferred-Items).txt`) [17].\
\
**Documentation Files:**\
Format: `v[Version]_[Class]_[Name].txt`\
*   **File Classes:**\
    *   **SPEC:** Specifications (e.g., `v4.0_SPEC_HA-Suite-Architecture-Reference.txt`) [18].\
    *   **REF:** Reference Documents (e.g., `v1.0_REF_Chronicler-Quick-Reference.txt`) [19].\
    *   **PLAN:** Planning Documents (e.g., `v1.0_PLAN_SeraphRecorder_Wishlist.txt`) [20].\
    *   **GUIDE:** User Guides (e.g., `v1.0_GUIDE_SeraphRecorder_Quick-Use.txt`) [20].\
\
**SeraphRecorder Extractions (Automated):**\
Files extracted from the pipeline use a semantic naming structure [21]:\
*   **Format:** `{DATE}_{TIME}_{PROJECT}_{SP}_{PASS}-{NUM}_notebook-query.txt`\
*   **Example:** `2026-02-09_053056_clgysing_SP03_< 2026/02/10 01:06:43.000251617  length=194 from=8693 to=8886
VX-01_notebook-query.txt`\
*   **Untagged Fallback:** `{DATE}_{TIME}_notebook-query.txt`
