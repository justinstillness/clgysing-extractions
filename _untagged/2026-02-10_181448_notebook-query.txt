The phase transition workflow is a governance protocol designed to ensure project continuity, context efficiency, and alignment when moving between major operational stages (e.g., from Extraction to Handshake). This process is defined within the **Governance & Continuity Components** (Items 22 & 23).

### The 8-Step Phase Transition Process
The transition follows a specific 8-step protocol designed to close out the current phase and prepare the environment for the next:

1.  **Assess Readiness:** Evaluate if the current phase objectives are met.
2.  **Husk Removal:** Discard obsolete context from the previous phase (see details below).
3.  **New PP (Phase Protocol) Draft:** Create the governing document for the new phase.
4.  **Review:** Analyze the new protocol for gaps.
5.  **Test:** Validate the new protocol logic.
6.  **Verify:** User confirmation of the new parameters.
7.  **Export:** Generate the standalone document.
8.  **Bootstrap Prep:** Create the initialization file for the next session. [1]

### What Happens Between Phases: Husk Removal
A critical concept during the transition is **Husk Removal**. This involves the "discard of obsolete context" to maintain token efficiency and focus. When a project pivots (e.g., a **Branch Shift** from extraction to handshake), the system discards the "husk" of the prior phase while preserving the essential "seed" or output data required for the next phase. [2], [3]

### Redrafting the Phase Protocol
The Phase Protocol (PP) is redrafted during step 3 of the transition. This new draft establishes the **Phase-Stable Boundary**, defining the specific scope, behavioral requirements, and objectives for the upcoming phase. [4] The drafting process requires a distinct Review, Test, and Verify cycle before the protocol is exported for use. [1]

### Updating the Project Guide (Summation/Grand Vision)
While the "Project Guide" serves as a high-level overview, the **Summation** or **Grand Vision** documents often function as the active context carriers that get updated during transitions.
*   **Intake & Review:** The system takes in "Group" batches or vision reviews to identify new emergents (e.g., new components like Master Thesis Intuition). [5]
*   **Gap Integration:** High-severity gaps and new requirements identified during the previous phase are mapped into the summation. [6]
*   **Version Increment:** The document version is updated (e.g., v1.1 to v1.2) to reflect the new state of the art, ensuring a "single source of truth" is passed forward to the next phase. [7]
*   **Emergent Flagging:** New discoveries (e.g., "NotebookLM Integration Hooks") are appended to the master list within these documents during the transition period. [8]
