Based on the provided sources, here are the planned future goals, the Layer 4 build plan phases, and the broader vision for the AWSNBLM infrastructure.\
\
### Layer 4 Build Plan Phases\
\"Layer 4\" focuses on closing the loop between data capture and usage by giving Claude direct visibility and control over the extraction repository. The build plan proposed in Session 017 consists of five phases [1, 2]:\
\
1.  **Phase 1: GitHub Repo Tool (Chronicler)**\
    *   **Goal:** Build a foundation for Claude to interact with the repository.\
    *   **Action:** Deploy a new MCP service (Chronicler) on port 8002 that allows Claude to list, read, create, move, rename, and delete files in the `clgysing-extractions` repo [3, 4].\
2.  **Phase 2: Extract.py Enhancement (Query-Time Signal Parsing)**\
    *   **Goal:** Enable automatic metadata tagging.\
    *   **Action:** Modify the extraction script to recognize \"Signal Strings\" (structured metadata blocks like `[SERAPH: PASS=VX...]`) embedded in queries. This allows the system to automatically populate file headers with the correct Source Package, Pass Type, and Theme [5, 6].\
3.  **Phase 3: Auto-Extraction**\
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate manual intervention.\
    *   **Action:** Implement a cron job or file watcher on the EC2 instance to run the extraction and push scripts automatically after traffic stops, removing the need to manually SSH in to trigger processing [2].\
4.  **Phase 4: File Routing & Concept Numbering**\
    *   **Goal:** Organize raw extractions and assign unique identifiers.\
    *   **Action:** Claude uses Chronicler to move files from the `_untagged/` landing zone into organized project folders (e.g., `/clgysing/phase2/VX/`). It also assigns sequential Concept IDs (e.g., `SP03-VX-001`) to individual concepts using a counter file to ensure provenance [2, 7].\
5.  **Phase 5: Notebook Integration**\
    *   **Goal:** Re-inject processed data into the research cycle.\
    *   **Action:** Claude reads organized extraction files from GitHub and uses Majeston to add them back into NotebookLM notebooks as sources, allowing for recursive research and analysis [2, 8].\
\
### Broader Vision: The LibForge Ecosystem\
The infrastructure connects to the **CLGYSING** content production workflow through the **LibForge** framework...a suite of tools designed to operationalize the \"Omniological Approach\" to research [9]. The vision is to create a \"hermeneutic framework\" or interpretive lens where raw information is progressively refined into structured concepts [10].\
\
*   **The \"Forge\" Metaphor:** The system is conceptualized as a forge where raw material is heated, measured, and shaped [9].\
    *   **Majeston (NotebookLM MCP):** The \"furnace\" that heats raw material through querying .\
    *   **Caliper (Document Analysis MCP):** The \"measuring tool\" for inventory and segmentation .\
    *   **Chronicler (GitHub Repo Tool):** The \"archivist\" that organizes and maintains the records [11].\
    *   **SeraphRecorder:** The \"pipeline\" that captures traffic between the user and the forge [12].\
*   **The Workflow Pipeline:**\
    1.  **Capture:** Seraph< 2026/02/08 00:24:01.000794281  length=1615 from=10159 to=11773
Recorder transparently captures all NotebookLM traffic [13].\
    2.  **Tagging:** \"Signal Strings\" (e.g., `[SERAPH: PROJECT=clgysing, SP=03, PASS=VX...]`) embedded in queries tell the system exactly what kind of work is being done (e.g., Vocabulary Extraction vs. Thematic Mapping) [14].\
    3.  **Organization:** Chronicler organizes these outputs into a structured library on GitHub [15].\
    4.  **Provenance:** A Concept ID system ensures every extracted concept can be traced back to its source, session, and extraction pass [16].\
\
### Planned Future Goals & Extensions\
Beyond Layer 4, the architecture reference outlines several future capabilities [17, 18]:\
\
*   **JSONL Archival Strategy:** Automatically pushing raw traffic logs to GitHub in a `raw/YYYY-MM/` structure to provide a permanent, browsable audit trail of all research activity [18].\
*   **Batch Operations:** Tools to move or organize multiple files in a single commit (`batch_move`, `batch_organize`) [17].\
*   **Search & Indexing:** A tool to search file contents across the repo (`search_files`) and a tool to build a metadata index (`metadata-index.json`) for quick lookups [19].\
*   **Webhook Integration:** Using GitHub webhooks to notify external automation systems (like n8n) when new files are pushed, triggering downstream workflows [19].\
*   **Future Tools:** The naming reference suggests future tools like **Anvil** (content generation/drafting), **Crucible** (synthesis), and **Flux** (data cleaning) [20-22].
