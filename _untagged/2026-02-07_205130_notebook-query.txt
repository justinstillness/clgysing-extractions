Based on the comprehensive extraction files provided, here are the significant concepts consolidated from the source documents.\
\
### **1. Omniology**\
*   **Core Content:** Describes the author's primary meta-framework and lifelong pursuit. It is defined as \"an attempt to understand myself, the nature of reality, the purpose of life, and how the understanding of truth in all its forms can improve everything from living with your family to running a business to organizing civilization itself\" [1, 2]. It is not abstract philosophy, but a \"commitment to follow [truth] wherever it leads\" [1, 3]. It serves as the umbrella discipline for the author's other frameworks, including Cultology and Agenda 47 Explained [4, 5].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Philosophy - Ontology / Core Framework\
*   **Relationships:** Foundation for **The Omniological Approach**, **Cultology**, and **Agenda 47 Explained**.\
\
### **2. The Omniological Approach**\
*   **Core Content:** The specific methodology used to conduct Omniology research. It requires \"understanding a subject from as many angles as possible, modeling it within my own conceptual frameworks (building intrinsic knowledge), and then integrating it with other domains\" [6-8]. The goal is to reason about subjects \"intrinsically rather than relying on authoritative statements or surface-level explanations\" [6, 9]. While it produces \"extremely robust frameworks,\" its downside is that it takes substantial time and creates a \"translation bottleneck\" regarding accessibility [10, 11].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Meta & Methodology\
*   **Relationships:** The method behind **Omniology**; produces **Intrinsic Knowledge**; solves the problem of reliance on **Authoritative Statements**.\
\
### **3. Intrinsic Knowledge**\
*   **Core Content:** A form of deep understanding built by modeling subjects within one's own \"conceptual frameworks\" and integrating them with other domains [12, 13]. It stands in direct contrast to \"extrinsic knowledge\" or \"authoritative statements\" [12, 14]. It enables an individual to reason independently and is the epistemic goal of the **Omniological Approach** [15].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Epistemology\
*   **Relationships:** The opposite of **Epistemic Closure** and **Extrinsic Knowledge**; the result of the **Omniological Approach**.\
\
### **4. Cultology**\
*   **Core Content:** The \"unified field theory for analyzing the mechanics of relationships, power, and belief systems across all scales of human activity\" [16, 17]. Described as the \"pathology of Omniology,\" it investigates what happens when relationships are hijacked and the \"flow of truth is obstructed\" [16, 17]. The framework is built on a \"moral and epistemic dichotomy\" between **The Parasitic Modality** and **The Symbiotic Modality** [17, 18].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - General / Core Framework\
*   **Relationships:** The theoretical foundation for **Agenda 47 Explained**; derived from **Omniology**; utilizes the **Parasitic Modality** and **Symbiotic Modality**.\
\
### **5. The Cultology Core Thesis**\
*   **Core Content:** The defining diagnostic criterion of the Cultology framework: \"any system that interrupts the natural flow of truth and growth is cult-like, and therefore parasitic\" [17, 19, 20].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - General\
*   **Relationships:** Defines **The Parasitic Modality**; central axiom of **Cultology**.\
\
### **6. The Parasitic Modality (Parasitic Systems)**\
*   **Core Content:** A social order defined not by ritual but by reliance on \"extrinsic knowledge: rigid beliefs enforced by social pressure and fear of exclusion\" [21, 22]. These systems \"hijack human potential,\" turning people into engines of labor and \"technology extraction\" [23]. They are characterized by \"epistemic closure\" (rigid dogmatic thinking) which suppresses the drive for inquiry [21, 22]. Every parasitic social order is essentially a \"counterfeit transcendence mechanism\" designed to prevent people from finding the ultimate source of truth [21, 24].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - Parasitic\
*   **Relationships:** The opposite of **The Symbiotic Modality**; the operating system of a **Macro-Cult**.\
\
### **7. The Symbiotic Modality (Symbiotic Systems)**\
*   **Core Content:** The positive counterpart to the parasitic modality. These systems are \"truth-centered and cultivate what I call the intrinsic path,\" which demands \"continual inquiry and openness to all information\" [25, 26]. Symbiosis is defined by the \"full flourishing of human relationsh< 2026/02/07 20:52:16.000215061  length=6629 from=16885 to=23513
ips into their ideal state, marked by freedom, honesty, creativity, and mutual benefit\" [25, 26]. It is described as a \"granular, actionable\" model rather than a vague dream [27, 28].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - Symbiotic\
*   **Relationships:** The opposite of **The Parasitic Modality**; the goal of the **Elite-led Symbiotic Transformation**.\
\
### **8. Macro-Cult (Civilizational Scale)**\
*   **Core Content:** The application of Cultology to the global scale. It argues that \"modern civilization is itself a macro-cult (an advanced parasitic system), functioning as a distributed cultic architecture that operates across families, businesses, governments, and global institutions\" [29-31].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - Parasitic\
*   **Relationships:** A scaled-up version of **The Parasitic Modality**; creates the **Technocratic Plantation**.\
\
### **9. Agenda 47 Explained**\
*   **Core Content:** A project that \"sits on top of the Cultology framework\" and uses the same foundational research to test a specific hypothesis: that \"Donald Trump might represent...though we cannot know for certain...the public face of an elite group attempting to transform society from parasitic to symbiotic\" [32-34]. It is framed not as political advocacy but as \"hypothesis-testing in real time\" regarding \"civilizational transformation\" [33, 35].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Strategy & Application / Case Study\
*   **Relationships:** A case study of **Cultology**; investigates the **Symbiotic Transformation Hypothesis**.\
\
### **10. The Technocratic Plantation (Globalist Development Projects)**\
*   **Core Content:** A metaphor for the modern parasitic civilization. It describes \"globalist development projects\" designed to entice humanity onto a \"technocratic plantation\" using modern conveniences as the \"shell of a Trojan horse\" [36, 37]. This shell conceals a \"toxic and freedom-destroying payload\" that creates dependency on control mechanisms [36, 38].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - Parasitic / Metaphor\
*   **Relationships:** The manifestation of the **Macro-Cult**; creates **Free-range Plantation** psychology.\
\
### **11. Free-Range Plantation (Historical Amnesia)**\
*   **Core Content:** A psychological state where generations born into the **Technocratic Plantation** \"forget what freedom actually looked like,\" confusing the \"meager benefits\" of their dependency with freedom itself [39, 40]. It posits that modern industrial dependency is mistakenly viewed as \"progress\" due to this loss of historical memory [39, 41].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Psychology - Dependency / History\
*   **Relationships:** The psychological result of the **Technocratic Plantation**; contrasted with **Eternal Vigilance**.\
\
### **12. The Four Intimacies**\
*   **Core Content:** A model defining the \"total field of human interaction and value exchange\" into four categories: \"Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Spiritual\" [42, 43]. \"Intellectual intimacy\" is identified as the \"keystone and immune system for the others.\" Cults corrupt these intimacies, turning \"authentic connection into extrinsic dependency\" [42, 43].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Psychology - Relationship Model\
*   **Relationships:** A sub-model of **Cultology**; corrupted by **The Parasitic Modality**.\
\
### **13. Ontology of Being & Corruption Cascade**\
*   **Core Content:** A model describing the structure of the human being: \"Personality ... Soul ... Mind ... Emotion ... Physical Expression\" [44, 45]. Parasitic systems execute a \"corruption cascade,\" which involves \"hijacking the core personality spark and inverting the entire value system\" [44, 46].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Philosophy - Ontology / Pathology\
*   **Relationships:** A sub-model of **Cultology**; explains the internal mechanism of **The Parasitic Modality**.\
\
### **14. Contractual Formalism**\
*   **Core Content:** A framework recognizing that \"all relationships are energetic, epistemic, and moral contracts\" [47, 48]. Symbiotic systems rely on \"honorable contracts\" (mutual, transparent, revocable), while cults use \"counterfeit contracts that hollow out genuine consent\" [47, 48].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - General / Law\
*   **Relationships:** A sub-model of **Cultology**; distinguishes between **Parasitic** and **Symbiotic** relationships.\
\
### **15. Pedagogical Spiral Staircase**\
*   **Core Content:** The author's writing and teaching strategy. It is designed to \"introduce concepts accessibly and then deepen them recursively (layer after layer), so that readers at different levels of familiarity can all find value\" [49-51]. It aims to bridge the gap between \"deeply technical\" readers and beginners without \"watering anything down\" [52].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Strategy & Application / Pedagogy\
*   **Relationships:** Used to present **Cultology** and **Agenda 47 Explained**; solves the \"translation bottleneck\" of the **Omniological Approach**.\
\
### **16. Third-Generation Research System**\
*   **Core Content:** A newly developed \"research organization and content production system\" that solves previous structural problems (managing 7,500+ pages of notes and the \"translation bottleneck\") [53-55]. It utilizes AI as a \"force multiplier\" to organize and synthesize data while maintaining \"human involvement, oversight, verification, and voice\" [55, 56].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Meta & Methodology\
*   **Relationships:** Enables the production of **Cultology** and **Agenda 47 Explained**; utilizes the **Omniological Approach**.\
\
### **17. Semantic Rehabilitation**\
*   **Core Content:** A linguistic strategy where the term \"cult\" is retained as a \"highly recognizable memetic handle\" but is \"immediately redefined\" to function as a \"precise investigative lens for social pathology rather than a pejorative label\" [57].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Strategy & Application / Linguistics\
*   **Relationships:** Applied within **Cultology**.\
\
### **18. Eternal Vigilance**\
*   **Core Content:** The conditional requirement for maintaining a free society. The text asserts that once truth is reclaimed, \"enslavers\" cannot deceive the population again, \"provided we remain eternally vigilant\" [58, 59].\
*   **Thematic Category:** Social Systems - Symbiotic\
*   **Relationships:** The safeguard for a **Symbiotic System**; the antidote to the **Free-Range Plantation**.
