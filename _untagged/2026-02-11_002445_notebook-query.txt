### **Vendor Notes:**\
*   **Cash App*Justin Deschamps:** There were approximately **$1,000** in debits to \"Cash App*Justin Deschamps\". These were excluded from the list above as they are classified as transfers to your own account/cash card rather than payments to a merchant [Source 1, 5, 32, 44, 45, etc.].\
*   **Credit First NA:** Totaling **$1,140**, these transactions were excluded as they are credit card payments (typically for Firestone/Auto repair lines of credit) [Source 47, 99, 121, 126, 447, 449].\
*   **Home Depot:** Transactions were a mix of \"Electronic Withdrawal\" and online payments.\
