Based on the sources, **D-024** refers to a known issue termed the "Socat Artifact Bug" affecting the `extract.py` script within the SeraphRecorder pipeline.

**Bug Details (D-024):**
*   **Symptom:** The extraction script occasionally leaves stray socat chunk headers embedded within the final extracted content body. These artifacts appear as lines resembling: `< 2026/02/08 05:42:04... length=6644...` [1].
*   **Cause:** The issue arises because `socat` splits large responses across multiple chunk boundaries. When these boundaries occur mid-text in a response, the header lines generated by `socat`'s verbose logging (`-v`) get captured as part of the content body rather than being parsed out as delimiters [1].
*   **Proposed Fix:** The documentation specifies that a regex (regular expression) pass needs to be added to `extract.py` to identify and strip these specific header patterns from the content body [1].
*   **Current Status:** As of Session 018 (February 8, 2026), this bug is listed as **"Identified, not yet fixed"** in the architecture reference [1].

**Technical Context:**
The `extract.py` script parses raw logs where `socat` records traffic with headers indicating direction (`> ` or `< `), timestamps, and length [2]. The parsing logic implemented in Session 014 was designed to handle block splitting, but D-024 indicates edge cases where chunk headers inside the stream are not correctly filtered [3, 4].
