\
**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
COMPLETING THIS TEMPLATE:\
1. START EARLY: Begin populating this template during the final phase, not after. Gather metrics and lessons while they're fresh.\
2. BE HONEST: The value is in accurate assessment, not positive spin. Future projects benefit from candid lessons learned.\
3. QUANTIFY WHERE POSSIBLE: Metrics tell the story better than narrative alone. Include actual numbers, dates, and measurements.\
4. FOCUS ON ACTIONABLE LESSONS: \"Communication could improve\" is not actionable. \"Weekly stakeholder email with standard format\" is actionable.\
5. OBTAIN SIGN-OFF: Formal closure prevents project resurrection and scope disputes. Get signatures before archiving.\
\
SCALING GUIDANCE:\
Small Projects (< 10 sessions):\
- Sections 1, 5, 8, 10 required\
- Other sections abbreviated or omitted\
- Single-page executive summary may suffice\
\
Medium Projects (10-50 sessions):\
- All sections recommended\
- Detail level moderate\
- Focus on lessons learned\
\
Large Projects (50+ sessions):\
- All sections required\
- High detail level\
- Consider separate lessons learned workshop\
- May require multiple reviewers\
\
AI-ASSISTED COMPLETION:\
This template can be partially completed by AI using:\
... Session logs as source material\
... Decision logs for Section 7 and lessons\
... Project artifacts for deliverables list\
\
Human verification required for:\
... Stakeholder satisfaction assessment\
... Political/organizational lessons\
... Sign-off sections\
... Final recommendations\

### TPL-023: Backlog Register\

**PURPOSE:**\
Living document for capturing, organizing, and tracking items deferred during project execution. Serves as both a parking lot during active work and a structured input source for future planning. Prevents good ideas from being lost while maintaining project focus.\
\
**WHEN TO USE:**\
- Throughout project lifecycle to capture deferred items\
- During scope discussions to document out-of-scope items\
- At phase transitions to review accumulated backlog\
- During planning to source future work items\
- At project closure to document outstanding items\
