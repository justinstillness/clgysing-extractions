Based on the revision findings and draft sections for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8, the session initiation sequence for continuing a project involves specific user actions, pre-session preparation using a \"New Chat Notepad,\" and a formal bootstrap loading protocol.\
\
### Pre-Session Preparation: The New Chat Notepad\
\
Field testing identified a critical user behavior called the **New Chat Notepad System**. This is an external scratchpad (e.g., Google Keep or a text file) used to prepare the session prompt before interacting with the AI [1].\
\
**Purpose:** It acts as a pre-prepared prompt to ensure efficient session initiation and prevent \"tabula rasa\" forgetfulness by the AI [2].\
\
**Preparation Steps (User Actions):**\
1.  **Update the Notepad:** Before starting, the user updates their external notepad with:\
    *   **Chat Name:** The correct naming convention for the upcoming session (e.g., `034 GOV-AIPM (Drafting Section 4.3)`) [1, 3].\
    *   **Standard Opening Line:** A consistent prompt such as \"Please review and let me know if you have any questions\" [1].\
    *   **Notebook References:** IDs and descriptions of relevant NotebookLM notebooks the AI needs to access [2, 3].\
    *   **Behavioral Reminders:** Specific instructions for behaviors the AI tends to forget (e.g., \"Narrate all tool calls\") [2].\
    *   **Context Updates:** Any notes or context that arose between sessions [2].\
2.  **Copy Content:** The user copies the entire content of this notepad to their clipboard [3].\
\
### Session Initiation Sequence (Continuation)\
\
The formal initiation sequence for a continuation session (Session N+1) follows a strict protocol to establish context and alignment.\
\
**1. Bootstrap Loading (User Action)**\
*   **Start New Chat:** The user creates a new chat in the project (ensuring the **Phase Protocol** is available in Project Knowledge) [3].\
*   **Paste & Attach:**\
    *   Paste the content from the **New Chat Notepad** into the message box [3].\
    *   Attach the **Bootstrap** file (generated at the end of the previous session) [3, 4].\
    *   Attach the **Session Log** (from the previous session) and any other required files [3].\
*   **Send:** The user sends this packet to initiate the session [3].\
\
**2. Mandatory First Action (AI Action)**\
*   Upon receiving the Bootstrap, the AI executes the **Mandatory First Action** defined in the Bootstrap [4].\
*   Typically, this action is to **review the Phase Protocol** stored in Project Knowledge to confirm adherence to behavioral governance before proceeding [5, 6].\
\
**3. Acknowledgment & Context Confirmation (AI Action)**\
*   The AI acknowledges the Bootstrap and confirms its understanding of the current state [4].\
*   It confirms continuity items, such as the **Response Index** (e.g., \"Last response index: [7], starting this session at [8]\") [9].\
*   If notebook connectivity is used, the AI confirms accessibility of the notebooks referenced in the Bootstrap [10].\
\
**4. The Alignment Turn (Mandatory Exchange)**\
*   **Generate Checklist:** The AI generates an **Alignment Checklist** covering scope, materials, workflow, expected outputs, and any gaps or questions [11, 12].\
*   **User Verification:** The user reviews this checklist. Work **does not proceed** until the user explicitly verifies alignment [13].\
    *   If aligned, the user confirms (e.g., \"Aligned\").\
    *   If misaligned, the user provides corrections, and the AI adjusts the plan [13].\
\
**5. Dependency Verification (AI Action)**\
*   The AI requests and verifies any specific dependencies noted in the Bootstrap (e.g., specific files or notebook queries) before beginning substantive work [14].\
\
### Summary of User Actions\
*   **Update New Chat Notepad** with session specifics [3].\
*   **Upload** Bootst< 2026/02/11 23:31:17.000232268  length=320 from=10159 to=10478
rap + Session Log + Notepad content [3].\
*   **Rename** the chat in the AI interface to match the convention (often pasting from the notepad) [15].\
*   **Verify** the Alignment Checklist presented by the AI [16].
