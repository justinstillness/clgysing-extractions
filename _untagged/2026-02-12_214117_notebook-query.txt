Based on the v1.0.8 revision plan and the artifact definitions established in Volumes 3 and 5, here is the full text of **Appendix G: Artifact Taxonomy Reference**, updated to reflect the new artifact ecosystem (Phase Protocols, Findings Reports, Branch Management artifacts).\
\
### **APPENDIX G: ARTIFACT TAXONOMY REFERENCE (v1.0.8)**\
\
#### **G.1 INTRODUCTION**\
\
This appendix provides a systematic classification framework for project artifacts, explaining why each artifact exists and how they relate to universal project functions. Users seeking practical guidance should reference **Section 5 (Canonical Project Artifacts)**; this appendix provides deeper theoretical grounding for those who want to understand the system's design rationale.\
\
The framework presented here analyzes universal project functions that any structured work requires. Understanding these functions illuminates why certain artifacts exist and prevents the creation of redundant documentation.\
\
#### **G.2 THE TWELVE UNIVERSAL PROJECT FUNCTIONS**\
\
Every project, regardless of domain, must address twelve core functions. These functions exist whether explicitly managed or handled ad hoc. The GOV-AIPM system addresses each through specific artifacts and workflows.\
\
**FUNCTION 1: PROJECT DEFINITION**\
*   **What:** Establishing boundaries, objectives, and identity\
*   **Why:** Without clear definition, work lacks direction and scope creep is inevitable\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Guide, TPL-001 (Project Initiation Form), Branch Startup File\
\
**FUNCTION 2: CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**\
*   **What:** Maintaining and transferring project knowledge across sessions\
*   **Why:** AI context windows are finite; external memory enables continuity\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap files (TPL-002), Phase Protocol, Notebooks, Session Logs, Cross-Branch Awareness Document\
\
**FUNCTION 3: SCOPE MONITORING**\
*   **What:** Tracking what's in-scope, out-of-scope, and deferred\
*   **Why:** Prevents scope creep; ensures intentional decisions about exclusions\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Guide, Backlog Register (TPL-023), Phase Protocol\
\
**FUNCTION 4: DECISION CAPTURE**\
*   **What:** Recording decisions with rationale and alternatives considered\
*   **Why:** Enables learning, prevents revisitation, supports auditability\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Decision Log (TPL-004), Findings Reports (evidence basis)\
\
**FUNCTION 5: PROGRESS TRACKING**\
*   **What:** Monitoring work completion against plan\
*   **Why:** Provides visibility; enables adjustment; demonstrates advancement\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Roadmap (TPL-010), Session Logs (TPL-005), Cross-Branch Awareness Document\
\
**FUNCTION 6: SESSION ORCHESTRATION**\
*   **What:** Managing individual work sessions...initiation, execution, closeout\
*   **Why:** Each session must accomplish meaningful work within constraints\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap (TPL-002), Phase Protocol, Session Closeout (TPL-003), Session Log\
\
**FUNCTION 7: PHASE MANAGEMENT**\
*   **What:** Organizing work into coherent phases with transitions\
*   **Why:** Complex projects require structured progression; phases enable planning\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Roadmap (TPL-010), Phase Protocol, Phase Execution Briefs\
\
**FUNCTION 8: QUALITY ASSURANCE**\
*   **What:** Verifying work meets standards and requirements\
*   **Why:** Prevents error accumulation; maintains deliverable quality\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Cross-AI Validation Protocol (TPL-008), Findings Reports, Phase Protocol (standards layer)\
\
**FUNCTION 9: ACCUMULATION HANDLING**\
*   **What:** Managing deferred items, insights, and out-of-phase discoveries\
*   **Why:** Not everything fits the current phase; systematic handling prevents loss\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Backlog Register (TPL-023), Findings Reports\
\
**FUNCTION 10: RECOVERY SUPPORT**\
*   **What:** Handling failures, errors, and unexpected situations\
*   **Why:** Problems occur; systematic recovery prevents cascading failures\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Failure Recovery Worksheet (TPL-009), Token Exhaustion Recovery Protocol\
\
**FUNCTION 11: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER**\
*   **What:** Moving information between contexts, sessions, and stakeholders\
*   **Why:** AI instances don't share memory; humans need structured briefings\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap files, Branch Startup Files, Closure Report Section 7, Re-Entry Checklist (TPL-007)\
\
**FUNCTION 12: PROJECT CLOSURE**\
*   **What:** Validating completion, documenting outcomes, preparing successors\
*   **Why:** Projects must end cleanly; lessons must transfer forward\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Closure Report (TPL-022)\
\
#### **G.3 ARTIFACT-TO-FUNCTION MAPPING (Updated v1.0.8)**\
\
The following table maps artifacts to the functions they serve. Note that most artifacts serve multiple functions...this is by design.\

\
#### **G.4 LIFECYCLE MAPPING**\
\
Different artifacts become relevant at different project phases. This mapping shows when each artifact is typically created, actively used, or primarily referenced.\

\
#### **G.5 ARTIFACT ECOSYSTEM PRINCIPLES**\
\
**PRINCIPLE 1: MINIMUM SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION**\
Create only artifacts that serve identified functions. Resist the urge to document for documentation's sake. Every artifact should answer: \"What function does this serve that isn't already served?\"\
\
**PRINCIPLE 2: INFORMATION LIVES IN ONE PLACE**\
Avoid duplicating information across artifacts. Cross-reference instead. When information must appear in multiple places, designate one as authoritative.\
\
**PRINCIPLE 3: ARTIFACTS CONNECT**\
Artifacts reference each other. The Bootstrap points to the Phase Protocol; the Findings Report points to the Decision Log; the Closure Report draws from the Backlog Register. These connections form a coherent system.\
\
**PRINCIPLE 4: ARTIFACTS EVOLVE**\
Some artifacts (Project Guide, Backlog Register, Cross-Branch Awareness) are living documents updated throughout the project. Others (Decision Log entries, Session Logs, Findings Reports) are append-only records.\
\
**PRINCIPLE 5: ARTIFACTS SERVE TRANSFER**\
Every artifact should support handoff...to a new AI session, to a future human reader, or to a follow-on project. Write for someone who has no context beyond what the artifact provides.
