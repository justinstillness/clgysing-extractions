Based on the sources provided, specifically the **Session 022 log**, the specific content of the other three observations (1, 3, and 4) from the **NLMINTA S014 briefing** (`awsnblm-briefing.txt`) is not explicitly detailed in the text.

However, the sources do confirm the following regarding the briefing:

*   **Observation 2:** Identified a gap regarding a **"purpose field"** (adding a field like `"purpose": "testing|production|infrastructure"` to the query manifest) [1].
*   **Observation 5:** Concerned **"combined pass guidance"** (how to classify queries that mix pass types). The discussion concluded that classification should be based on **PRIMARY intent**, with secondary intent noted in the manifest [1].
*   **Observations 1 and 4:** The response notes that these **"confirm what we expected"** regarding the system design [1], [2]. While their specific content isn't quoted, the session had just previously defined design principles regarding **filename conventions** (P-1) and **degree classifications** (P-3) [3], [4], suggesting these topics may align with the expected confirmations.
*   **Observation 3:** There is no explicit mention of Observation 3 in the provided session log [1], [5].

The session prior to the briefing (Session 022) extensively discussed **filename convention validation** (ensuring filenames are self-identifying) and **degree classifications** (D1 through DM refinement levels) [4], [6], [7]. The **pass type codes** were also a central topic of the **Indexer Specification** created in that session [8], [9].
