================================================================================

Based on the sources provided, the **VX** (Vocabulary Extraction) and **GL** (Glossary Generation) pass types are **distinct** components within the LibForge/NLMINTA extraction pipeline. They serve different stages of the data lifecycle: VX is an *extraction* tool (gathering raw data), while GL is a *consolidation* or *administrative* tool (organizing extracted data).\
\
### 1. VX (Vocabulary Extraction)\
*   **Definition:** VX is an extraction pass designed to identify and extract specialized terms, jargon, and definitions directly from a source package [1]. Unlike Concept Extraction (TX), which focuses on broad ideas and frameworks, VX focuses on \"terminology precision\"...capturing exactly how terms are defined and used in context [2].\
*   **Introduction:** VX was introduced and validated during **Session 010**. It was developed as a \"New Pass Type\" alongside Thesis Strings (TS) and Evaluation (EV) to ensure distinct data output classes rather than combining them into single queries [3], [4].\
*   **Output:** It produces structured entries containing the term, definition, usage context, and related terms [3]. These outputs are considered \"Degree 1\" (raw extraction) artifacts [5], [6].\
\
### 2. GL (Glossary Generation)\
*   **Definition:** GL is classified as an \"Administrative / Non-Extraction Pass\" [7]. Its purpose is to generate a consolidated glossary from vocabulary that has *already* been extracted (usually via VX passes) [8]. It functions as a refinement step to create a unified terminology reference across the corpus [9].\
*   **Introduction:** GL was formally introduced in **Session 013** within the *Signal String Initial Conventions* specification (and the parallel *Signal String Format Considerations* document) [10], [11]. It was added to the \"Pass Type Registry\" as part of the infrastructure for organizing files, rather than as a primary extraction test in the earlier sessions [8].\
*   **Output:** It produces a consolidated, harmonized terminology reference, often classified as a \"Degree 2\" (refined) or \"Degree 3\" (consolidated) artifact [8], [12].\
\
### Key Differences and Relationship\
The relationship between the two is hierarchical and sequential:\
\
| Feature | **VX (Vocabulary Extraction)** | **GL (Glossary Generation)** |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| **Type** | Extraction Pass [7] | Administrative Pass [7] |\
| **Function** | Extracts raw terms from specific sources. | Consolidates extracted terms into a master list. |\
| **Input** | Raw Source Material (e.g., source packages). | Extracted VX outputs (Degree 1 artifacts). |\
| **Stage** | Phase 2 (Extraction) [13]. | Phase 2/3 (Harmonization/Maintenance) [14]. |\
| **Defined In** | Session 010 [15]. | Session 013 [7]. |\
\
**Are they overlapping?**\
They do not overlap in function; they are complementary. **VX** provides the raw input that **GL** organizes. For example, the sources indicate that GL is often a \"product of VX passes\" [8]. The confusion may arise because VX produces \"glossary entries\" [1], but the GL pass type is reserved for the *act* of generating the consolidated master glossary document itself [9].
