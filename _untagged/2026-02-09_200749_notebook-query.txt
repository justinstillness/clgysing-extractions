Based on the session logs, architecture references, and closeout summaries from Sessions 008 through 020, here is the consolidated list of deferred items, pending tasks, and backlog items for the AWSNBLM project.\
\
### **Repeatedly Deferred Items**\
These items have appeared in the \"Deferred\" or \"Not Done\" lists of multiple sequential sessions.\
\
*   **GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) Rotation**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 011 (Security note regarding token visibility in chat) [1].\
    *   **Status:** Deferred in Sessions 013, 016, 018, and 020 [2-5].\
    *   **Reason:** Avoiding disruption to the active Caliper service during pipeline builds.\
*   **Socat Artifact Stripping (D-024)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 013 (Identified stray chunk headers in extraction output) [6].\
    *   **Status:** Formalized as Decision D-024 in Session 018 but deferred. Still pending as of Session 020 closeout [5, 7].\
    *   **Task:** Add regex pass in `extract.py` to strip `&lt; YYYY/MM/DD... length=...` headers from content bodies.\
*   **Architecture Reference Update (v3.2)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 018 (Need to document Tailscale, Chronicler fixes, and pipeline) [4].\
    *   **Status:** Deferred in Session 018 and Session 020 [4, 5].\
    *   **Current State:** The canonical doc is still v3.1 (Session 011).\
*   **jacob-bd Package Update (v0.2.16)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 011 (Identified via `server_info`) [8].\
    *   **Status:** Noted as non-urgent/deferred in Sessions 011, 016, and Architecture Reference v3.1 [3, 9].\
\
---\
\
### **Pending Technical Debt & Maintenance**\
\
*   **Counter Reset**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 018 [4].\
    *   **Task:** Reset the `concept-counter.json` file in the GitHub repo to 0 before production use (currently holds test data like `SP03-VX: 8`).\
*   **Health Check Script Update**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 011 [1].\
    *   **Task:** Update `health-check.sh` on EC2 to include service checks for Caliper and Chronicler (currently only checks Majeston).\
*   **Remove Debug Flags**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 014 [10].\
    *   **Task:** Remove `--verbose` debug output from `extract.py` for production use.\
*   **JSONL Archival Implementation (D-019)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 017 [11].\
    *   **Status:** Decision D-019 established the strategy (push daily JSONL to `/raw/YYYY-MM/` on GitHub), but the modification to `push-to-github.sh` was deferred in Session 020 [5].\
\
---\
\
### **Backlog: Feature Development (Layer 4 & 5)**\
\
*   **Auto-Extraction (W-005)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 017 (Wishlist) [12].\
    *   **Task:** Implement cron job or file watcher to run extraction/push automatically after traffic ceases, removing the manual trigger step.\
*   **Concept ID Numbering**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 017 [13].\
    *   **Task:** Build logic (likely via Chronicler) to read extracted files, identify concept boundaries, and assign sequential IDs using the counter system.\
*   **Notebook Integration (W-003)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 017 [14].\
    *   **Task:** Close the loop by having Claude read organized extractions from GitHub and add them back into NotebookLM as sources via Majeston.\
*   **AIPM Repo Integration (W-006)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 018 [15].\
    *   **Task:** Scope ability to write project management artifacts (session logs, bootstraps) directly to the GitHub repo via Chronicler.\
*   **Shell MCP Connector (EC2 Access)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 020 [5, 16].\
    *   **Task:** Build a 4th MCP tool to expose EC2 shell commands (read/< 2026/02/09 20:08:27.000190736  length=754 from=8513 to=9266
write/exec) to Claude, solving the \"Claude cannot SSH\" limitation permanently.\
\
---\
\
### **Deferred Items from Early Architecture**\
\
*   **Filesystem MCP (EC2 Inbox)**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 008 [17].\
    *   **Status:** Effectively superseded by the Google Drive bridge discovery (Session 009) and the GitHub repo pipeline, but technically the \"Shell MCP Connector\" (Session 020) is the spiritual successor to this backlog item [16, 18].\
*   **Route 53 Migration**\
    *   **Origin:** Session 003.\
    *   **Status:** Documented as deferred/not needed in v3.1 Architecture Reference; GoDaddy DNS is functioning adequately [19].
