Query:           What automation plans existed before the JSON discovery? How was the extraction pipeline expected to work with respect to extract.py, SeraphRecorder capture, Chronicler organization, and concept-counter serialization? What role was JSON already anticipated to play, and what were the limitations of prose-based extraction for automation?

Based on the sources, there is **no specific preference** stated between Section 3.5 and Section 3.8 for the placement of Callout 7. The documentation provides multiple valid options without ranking them.\
\
According to the **Draft User Behavior Callouts** document, the placement instruction is flexible:\
\
*   **Placement:** \"Section 3 (Explicit Alignment Principle) ... INSERT at end of section, or as a callout within Section 3.5 (Dialog Intake System) or Section 3.8 (Instruction Chain Interpretation)\" [1].\
\
The **Master Assembly Blueprint** reiterates this flexibility without narrowing the recommendation:\
\
*   **User Behavior Callouts:** \"Callout 7 (Prompting Discipline) ... Section 3 (3.5 or 3.8)\" [2].\
\
Both locations are considered appropriate because the callout addresses how users should structure their inputs (relevant to **Dialog Intake**, Section 3.5) and how they should command multi-step actions (relevant to **Instruction Chain Interpretation**, Section 3.8).
