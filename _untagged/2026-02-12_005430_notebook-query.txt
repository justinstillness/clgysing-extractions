Based on the sources, there is **no specific preference** stated between Section 3.5 and Section 3.8 for the placement of Callout 7. The documentation provides multiple valid options without ranking them.

According to the **Draft User Behavior Callouts** document, the placement instruction is flexible:

*   **Placement:** "Section 3 (Explicit Alignment Principle) ... INSERT at end of section, or as a callout within Section 3.5 (Dialog Intake System) or Section 3.8 (Instruction Chain Interpretation)" [1].

The **Master Assembly Blueprint** reiterates this flexibility without narrowing the recommendation:

*   **User Behavior Callouts:** "Callout 7 (Prompting Discipline) ... Section 3 (3.5 or 3.8)" [2].

Both locations are considered appropriate because the callout addresses how users should structure their inputs (relevant to **Dialog Intake**, Section 3.5) and how they should command multi-step actions (relevant to **Instruction Chain Interpretation**, Section 3.8).
