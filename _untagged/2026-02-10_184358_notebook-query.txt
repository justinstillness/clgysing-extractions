Based on the provided sources, specifically the transcript of **Session 022**, there is no record of Claude Code performing specific diagnostics or applying config changes to **fix** the basic auth loop. The session ended immediately after the issue was identified and before troubleshooting steps were executed.

Here is the sequence of events recorded in the sources:

*   **Deployment:** Claude Code successfully deployed the File Browser app and configured Caddy on the EC2 instance [1].
*   **Issue Identification:** You reported that despite entering the correct username and password, the browser "keeps asking for it again and again" (a basic auth loop) [2].
*   **Suggested Diagnostics:** The assistant advised you to ask Claude Code to "Fix the Caddy basic auth loop," noting that the issue is likely due to **hash format mismatch**, **route ordering**, or **username case sensitivity** [2].
*   **Action Taken:** You decided not to troubleshoot immediately, stating, "We should close out and start fresh with any trouble shooting" [3].
*   **Current Status:** The session closeout listed "File Browser auth loop ... Claude Code troubleshooting in progress" as an **Open Item** carrying forward to the next session [4].

Therefore, the specific commands or config changes applied to resolve the loop are not present in the provided text.
