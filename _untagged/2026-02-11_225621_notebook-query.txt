Based on the *Revision Findings & Plan* (Source 032), **Category 12** and **Category 14** address the structural management of complex, multi-stream projects.

### Category 12: Three-Tier Documentation Architecture
This category establishes a pattern for managing documentation to prevent information overload by separating concerns into three distinct levels [1, 2].

*   **Tier 1: Architecture References (System Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as the "single source of truth" for the system.
    *   **Content:** High-level blueprints, design philosophy, and component interrelations.
    *   **Stability:** These documents remain stable across the project [2].
*   **Tier 2: Per-Tool/Component References (Operational Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** Bridges architecture to execution for specific agents or components.
    *   **Content:** Granular specifications for individual tools or processes.
    *   **Updates:** These are updated specifically when a tool or component changes [2].
*   **Tier 3: CHANGELOGs (Temporal Level)**
    *   **Purpose:** distinct from static specs, this tracks the evolution of the system over time.
    *   **Content:** Version history, decisions, and progression.
    *   **Function:** Provides "context continuity" for future sessions [2].

**Implementation Note:** This architecture was formally adopted in Session 021 (D-027) for the "Havona Anvil Suite," replacing monolithic specifications with a suite architecture reference (Tier 1), individual tool references for components like SeraphRecorder and Caliper (Tier 2), and a running changelog (Tier 3) [3-5].

### Category 14: Inter-Branch Communication
This category formalizes mechanisms for coordination between parallel workstreams (branches) under a single project [6].

*   **Cross-Branch Awareness Document:** A proposed document that sits alongside the Phase Protocol in project knowledge. It lists all active branches, their objectives, and coordination needs, ensuring every session maintains awareness of parallel efforts [7].
*   **Context Sharing Mechanisms:**
    *   **Shared Notebooks:** Using a main project notebook that all branches can access [7].
    *   **Artifact Injection:** Explicitly uploading relevant artifacts (outputs) from one branch's notebook into another branch's context when dependencies exist [7].
    *   **Dependency Mapping:** Explicitly mapping inter-branch dependencies during rooting or branch startup [8].
