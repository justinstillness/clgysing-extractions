.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
... **USER BEHAVIOR: Prompting Discipline**                             ...
...                                                                     ...
... Compose complex responses in an external notepad before pasting     ...
... into the AI interface. This prevents accidental sends of incomplete ...
... messages and allows you to review your own clarity before the AI    ...
... processes it.                                                       ...
...                                                                     ...
... When providing direction on decisions, use this formula:            ...
...                                                                     ...
... [State your thinking] +                                             ...
... [Provide your direction] +                                          ...
... "Let me know if you think there's a better way or if my             ...
... thinking is incorrect."                                             ...
...                                                                     ...
... The final clause is critical. AI assistants default to compliance   ...
... ... they will execute your direction even if it is suboptimal. You    ...
... must explicitly invite disagreement to receive honest feedback.     ...
... Without this invitation, the AI treats your direction as a          ...
... command rather than a proposal.                                     ...
...                                                                     ...
... This practice complements the AI's "alignment over assumption"      ...
... principle (Section 2.2.3): the AI proposes and pauses; you direct   ...
... and invite challenge.                                               ...
