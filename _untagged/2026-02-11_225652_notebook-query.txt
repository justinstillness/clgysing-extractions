Based on the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.8 Drafting Plan**, here is the detailed plan for **Drafting Session F**.\
\
### **Session F: User Behaviors, Three-Tier Architecture, Failure Modes, & Inter-Branch Communication**\
*   **Categories:** 7, 12, 13, 14\
*   **Estimated Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH\
*   **Dependencies:** Requires content from Sessions A-E to exist so user callouts can be accurately placed.\
\
---\
\
### **1. Priority Ordering & Scope**\
The session will proceed in the following order to ensure structural elements (Architecture/Communication) are defined before embedding user behaviors into them.\
\
1.  **User Behaviors (Category 7):** Creating embedded callouts throughout the manual (Sections 3, 4, 6, 10).\
2.  **Three-Tier Documentation Architecture (Category 12):** New pattern definition (Section 12 or 6).\
3.  **Failure Modes (Category 13):** Enhancements to Section 14 and Appendix F.\
4.  **Inter-Branch Communication (Category 14):** New section complementing Branch Management (from Session D).\
5.  **Quality Audits:** Comprehensive review of Section 6 (External Organization) and Appendix F.\
\
---\
\
### **2. Content Items (Target Sections)**\
\
#### **A. User Behaviors (Embedded Callouts)**\
*   **Action:** Embed clearly marked **USER ACTION** or **USER BEHAVIOR** callout boxes within relevant AI-facing sections.\
*   **Target Content:**\
    *   **Project Handle Naming:** Short, consistent tags (3-10 chars) (Section 6).\
    *   **New Chat Notepad System:** Pre-prepared prompts/reminders (Section 4.3).\
    *   **Session Naming Convention:** `[session#] [HANDLE] ([descriptor])` (Section 6).\
    *   **File Organization:** Folder structures for chats, artifacts, guides (Section 6).\
    *   **Post-Session Housekeeping:** Downloads, verification, notebook uploads (Section 4.3 or 6).\
    *   **Pre-Session Housekeeping:** Chat naming, bootstrap loading (Section 4.3).\
    *   **Prompting Discipline:** Using external notepads, inviting disagreement (Section 3 or 10).\
    *   **NotebookLM Maintenance:** Upload cadence and querying directives (Section 10).\
\
#### **B. Three-Tier Documentation Architecture (New Section)**\
*   **Location:** Section 12 or 6.\
*   **Concept:** Defined pattern for managing complex project documentation.\
    1.  **Architecture References (System Level):** High-level blueprints, stable philosophy.\
    2.  **Per-Tool/Component References (Operational Level):** Granular specs updated with component changes.\
    3.  **CHANGELOGs (Temporal Level):** Sequential history of evolution.\
*   **Guidance:** When to apply this pattern and how it connects to file naming.\
\
#### **C. Section 14 Failure Modes (Enhancement)**\
*   **Action:** Extend existing failure mode catalog with field-tested issues.\
*   **New Modes< 2026/02/11 22:57:24.000207051  length=2340 from=10159 to=12498
:**\
    *   **Bootstrap Verification Failures:** Session number increments, handle confusion.\
    *   **AI Behavioral Forgetfulness:** Root causes and workaround (reminders).\
    *   **External Knowledge Contamination:** Hallucinated connections not in source.\
    *   **Synthesis Layer Degradation:** Logic errors during multi-query synthesis.\
    *   **Context Invisibility:** Transcript gaps from MCP tools (linked to Connector Transparency Protocol).\
\
#### **D. Inter-Branch Communication (New Section)**\
*   **Location:** Section 12 or adjacent to Branch Management.\
*   **Content:**\
    *   **Cross-Branch Awareness Document:** Concept and template usage.\
    *   **Coordination Patterns:** How parallel branches share context.\
    *   **Notebook Strategy:** Using shared notebooks for cross-branch awareness.\
\
#### **E. Quality Audits**\
*   **Section 6 (External Organization):** Comprehensive review of naming conventions and folder structures against field-tested patterns.\
*   **Appendix F (Failure Catalog):** Review to determine if new failure modes warrant full catalog entries.\
\
---\
\
### **3. Templates**\
*   **Updated Failure Recovery References** (if needed).\
*   **Cross-Branch Awareness Document Template** (Note: Drafting Plan indicates this might have been drafted in Session D; Session F ensures integration).\
\
---\
\
### **4. \"Done\" Criteria**\
To consider Session F complete, the following must be verified:\
*   [ ] **User behavior callouts** are embedded and clearly marked throughout relevant sections.\
*   [ ] **Three-Tier Documentation Architecture** section is drafted.\
*   [ ] **Failure Mode Catalog** is extended with the 5 new field-tested modes.\
*   [ ] **Inter-Branch Communication** section is drafted.\
*   [ ] **Section 6 Quality Audit** is complete and enhancements integrated.\
*   [ ] All user-facing guidance is identifiable and accessible.\
\
---\
\
### **5. Research Needs**\
*   **AWSNBLM Notebook:** Query for \"behavioral forgetfulness\" examples.\
*   **NLMINTA Notebook:** Query for \"three-tier documentation\" examples.\
*   **All Notebooks:** Query for \"inter-branch communication\" patterns.\
*   **Current Manual:** Review Section 6 for existing gaps.
