Based on the sources, **Insight Capture** (also referred to as the **Out-of-Phase Backlog** mechanism) is a formal protocol designed to handle valuable ideas that arise during a session but fall outside the current phase's scope. Its primary purpose is to prevent scope creep while ensuring valuable insights are preserved for future use [1].

The system operates on a **Two-Phase Workflow** involving specific capture, evaluation, and routing procedures [1].

### Phase 1: Capture (In-Session)
This phase occurs immediately when an out-of-scope idea surfaces during active work.
*   **Trigger:** The AI auto-detects scope expansion (via its **Scope Monitoring Duty**) or the user flags an item [1], [2].
*   **Action:** The AI pauses to conduct a **brief containable survey** (typically 3-5 questions) to document the idea without derailing the current session [1].
*   **Output:** A **Backlog Item Report** is generated containing provenance data (source session, context) [1].
*   **Result:** Work immediately returns to the current scope, minimizing distraction [1].

### Phase 2: Evaluation & Routing (Dedicated Session)
This phase occurs periodically (e.g., at phase transitions or dedicated planning sessions) to process accumulated items [1].
*   **Action:** Review and evaluate each captured item [3].
*   **Routing Destinations:** Items are assigned to one of several paths [3]:
    *   New component/feature
    *   Future task
    *   Specific document update
    *   Discard (if deemed not actionable)

### Backlog Item Schema
Captured items follow a specific structure to ensure actionable context is preserved [3]:
*   **ID:** Backlog-Item-[NNN]
*   **Description:** Concise summary of the idea.
*   **Context:** What triggered the insight (provenance).
*   **Potential Impact:** Value or consequence of the item.
*   **Suggested Routing:** Initial thought on where it belongs.
*   **Priority Assessment:** High/Medium/Low.
*   **Status Tracking:** Follows the lifecycle **CAPTURED ... EVALUATED ... ROUTED** [3].

### The Backlog Register (TPL-023)
The **Backlog Register** serves as the repository for these items. It is integrated into the project lifecycle through a "Reporting Triad" alongside the Project Roadmap and Closure Report [4], [5]. It typically contains four sections [6], [7]:
1.  **Current Project Backlog:** Items deferred from immediate work but intended for the current project.
2.  **Version Backlog:** Items designated for future versions (e.g., v2.0).
3.  **Process Improvements:** Observations about the workflow itself.
4.  **Parking Lot:** Ideas of uncertain value saved for later review.

This system ensures that the AI's **Scope Monitoring Duty**...which requires detecting and flagging scope expansion...has a constructive outlet, allowing the AI to say, "This appears to extend beyond our current phase scope... should we backlog this item?" rather than silently expanding the work [2], [8].
