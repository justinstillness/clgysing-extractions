Here is the full text of the **Alignment Checklist** template from the Session B draft.\
\
Note: The draft uses the placeholder ID `TPL-0XX`. Based on the context of your query, this corresponds to the artifact you are identifying as **TPL-012**.\

\
**TPL-0XX: ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Standard structure for the Alignment Turn at session start. Ensures shared understanding of scope, materials, workflow, and expected outputs before substantive work begins.\
**When to Use:** At the start of every continuation session, after the AI has reviewed the Phase Protocol and acknowledged the Bootstrap.\
**Cross-reference:** Section 4.3.1.1 (The Alignment Turn), Section 4.3.1 (Session Initiation)\
\
---\
\
### **INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
The AI generates this checklist proactively as part of the session initiation sequence. The user does not need to request it ... the Alignment Turn is a mandatory step in the continuation protocol.\
\
The checklist should be adapted to match session complexity:\
*   **Simple continuation:** Concise checklist covering scope and materials\
*   **Complex multi-deliverable session:** Thorough checklist with detailed workflow and dependency verification\
\
The AI draws checklist content from:\
*   The Bootstrap (primary source for scope, materials, and priorities)\
*   User input at session start (adjustments, additions, clarifications)\
*   Phase Protocol (behavioral context and standing requirements)\
\
The user reviews the checklist and responds with confirmation, corrections, or additional context. Work proceeds only after explicit user confirmation.\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
The AI generates this automatically. If the AI omits the alignment turn, the user can prompt: *\"Let's do the alignment checklist\"* or *\"Run through TPL-0XX before we start.\"*\

\
### **TEMPLATE NOTES**\
\
**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\
This template is intentionally lightweight. The Alignment Turn should feel like a brief, productive handshake ... not a bureaucratic gate. The checklist verifies shared understanding without consuming excessive tokens.\
\
The template captures the minimum viable alignment check. The AI should expand depth where complexity warrants it (e.g., a session with 8 deliverables needs more detailed workflow planning than a session with 1), but the basic structure remains consistent.\
\
**RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TEMPLATES:**\
The Alignment Checklist is generated by the AI, not completed by the user. It draws from:\
*   **TPL-002 (Bootstrap)** ... provides the raw material for scope, materials, and priorities\
*   **Phase Protocol** ... provides behavioral context\
\
It feeds into:\
*   **TPL-005 (Session Log)** ... the session objective recorded in the log should match the confirmed alignment scope\
*   **TPL-003 (Session Closeout Checklist)** ... the loose ends assessment at closeout references back to the alignment scope to identify divergences [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]
