Based on the **GOV-AIPM Revision Findings (Session 032)** and **Drafting Plan (Session 033)**, here are the details regarding notebook context recovery, organization, and workflow.\
\
### 1. Exhaustive Querying Technique\
This technique allows the AI to build comprehensive context from NotebookLM without consuming the full token budget by loading entire documents. It follows a specific loop to ensure \"saturation\" of the topic.\
\
*   **The Loop:**\
    1.  **Query:** The AI queries NotebookLM on a specific subject.\
    2.  **Summarize:** The AI summarizes the information received from the query.\
    3.  **Gap Question:** The AI explicitly asks, \"Is there anything else I'm missing?\" or a similar gap-seeking follow-up.\
    4.  **Repeat:** This cycle repeats until the responses start returning similar content (saturation), indicating the AI has retrieved the complete context available in the notebook [1-3].\
\
### 2. Notebook Organization Strategy\
The framework recommends a tiered approach to organizing notebooks to balance accessibility with specificity.\
\
*   **Main Project Notebook:** The general rule is to have **one main notebook** for the entire project. All branches should generally access this central repository to maintain shared context [2, 3].\
*   **Adjunct Notebooks:** Create separate, \"adjunct\" notebooks for specific targeted purposes, such as:\
    *   Specific branches (e.g., a testing branch vs. a tooling branch).\
    *   External research repositories.\
    *   Specification documentation [2].\
    *   *Example:* In the NLMINTA project, separate notebooks were used for \"AIPM Review Material,\" \"NLMINTA Sessions,\" and \"AWSNBLM Session Transcripts\" [4].\
\
### 3. Source Efficiency for Limited Plans\
For users on limited NotebookLM plans (which restrict the number of sources), the framework provides a consolidation technique.\
\
*   **Consolidation Method:** Instead of uploading every individual session transcript as a separate source file, consolidate multiple session transcripts into a single **Google Doc** with separate tabs or headings for each session.\
*   **Sync:** Upload/sync this single Google Doc as one source. This allows you to add many sessions of data while only consuming one \"source slot\" in the notebook [2, 3].\
\
### 4. What to Upload vs. Skip\
The goal of the notebook is to serve as a **deep context archive** (everything that happened), while the Bootstrap serves as a lightweight orientation tool (where we left off).\
\
*   **Upload:**\
    *   **Transcripts:** Always upload the full chat transcript. This is the primary source of deep memory [1].\
    *   **Non-Ephemeral Artifacts:** Upload specifications (SPECs), work-in-progress reports (WIPs), findings reports, and research documents. These represent the crystallized intelligence of the project [1, 5].\
*   **Skip:**\
    *   **Bootstraps & Session Logs:** These are considered \"purely ephemeral\" in the context of the deep archive. They are essential for the *immediate* next session (loaded into the chat window), but they do not need to be permanently archived in the notebook because the transcript and specific artifacts already contain the detailed information [1].\
\
### 5. Notebook Index (or Directory) Concept\
To help the AI know *where* to look without wasting tokens querying every notebook blindly, you create a master reference document.\
\

*   **The Manifest:** This is a single file listing all your notebook IDs, their contents/summaries, and their specific purposes.\
*   **Function:** It gives the AI a \"map\" of your external memory.\
*   **Creation Method:** You can create this by querying each notebook for a summary of itself, then compiling those summaries into a single \"Notebook Directory\" document [6, 7].\
\
### 6. Upload Workflow (Post-Session)\
This \"Post-Session Housekeeping\" protocol ensures the deep context layer remains current [1, 5, 8].\
\
1.  **Download:** At the end of a session, download the transcript (via an exporter tool) and all artifacts produced.\
2.  **Local Organization:** Store these in your local session folder.\
3.  **Upload to Notebook:** Upload the transcript and any new non-ephemeral artifacts (specs, findings) to the Main or Adjunct project notebook.\
4.  **Sync:** If using the Google Doc consolidation method, copy the new transcript into the master Doc and re-sync the source in NotebookLM.
