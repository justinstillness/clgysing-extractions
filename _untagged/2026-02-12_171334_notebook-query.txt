Based on the sources, specifically the **TPL-005 Session Log Template (v2.0)** revision, the required format structure and fields for a session log are as follows:

### **1. Header Block**
*   **File Class:** (e.g., LOG)
*   **Project:** Project Name (Brief Description)
*   **Session:** Session Number, Project Code, and Session Purpose (e.g., `034 GOV-AIPM (Session Lifecycle Drafting)`)
*   **Date:** Date or date range
*   **Session Type:** Phase Name ... Activity Type (e.g., `Phase 2 ... Execution`)

### **2. Session Objective**
*   **Primary:** The main goal stated at the start of the session.
*   **Secondary:** Any additional goals, if applicable.

### **3. Work Accomplished**
*   **List of Activities:** Numbered list of major activities and outputs (specific document names, versions, or counts).
*   **Objective Achieved:** Assessment field (`FULL` / `PARTIAL` / `MINIMAL`).
*   **Variance Note:** If Partial or Minimal, an explanation of what was not completed and why.

### **4. Decisions Made**
*   **Decisions Table:** Columns for `Decision #` (e.g., D-001) and `Brief Description`.
*   **Total Decisions:** Count of decisions made this session.
*   *(Note: Full rationale belongs in the separate Decision Log; this is a summary/reference).*

### **5. Scope Observations**
*   **Planned vs. Actual:** Comparison of intended work versus actual execution.
*   **Emerged:** Unplanned items, new insights, or concerns that surfaced.
*   **Scope Expansions Flagged:** Any expansions noted (with decision references if formally decided).

### **6. Phase Progress**
*   **Phase Status:** Brief status (e.g., "~95% complete").
*   **Completion Criteria:** Checklist of criteria with status marks (`[...]`, `[~]`, `[ ]`).
*   **Estimated Phase Completion:** Percentage estimate.

### **7. Issues Encountered**
*   **Issues Table:** Columns for `Issue`, `Status` (Resolved/Open/Deferred/Noted), and `Resolution/Notes`.

### **8. Files Produced**
*   **Files Table:** Columns for `File Name`, `File Class` (e.g., DRAFT, SPEC, LOG), and `Description`.
*   **Total Artifacts:** Count of files generated.

### **9. Response Index Register**
*   **Index Table:** Mapping of `Index` (e.g., `[1]`) to `Semantic Title`.
*   **Session Index Range:** Start and end index numbers for the session.
*   **Next Session Start Index:** The index number the next session should begin with.

### **10. Session Fidelity Report (Embedded)**
A structured assessment section containing:
*   **Status:** `DRAFT` or `CONFIRMED`.
*   **Work Accomplished:** Planned vs. Actual comparison.
*   **Phase Progress:** Completion criteria status.
*   **Decisions Crystallized:** Summary of formal decisions.
*   **Gaps & Insights Identified:** Missing info, discoveries, process improvements.
*   **Handoff Status:** Context carried forward, materials needed, risks/warnings.
*   **Next Session Projection:** Focus, success criteria, and complexity estimate.
*   **Verification:** User verification status.

### **11. Bootstrap Status**
*   **Generated:** `YES` / `NO`.
*   **File Name:** Name of the generated bootstrap file.
*   **Target Session:** Number of the next session.
*   **Suggested Next Session Name:** Naming convention for the subsequent session.

**File Naming Convention:**
The manual specifies naming these files as `[###]_session-log.txt` (e.g., `034_session-log.txt`), maintained as individual files per session rather than a single appended document.
