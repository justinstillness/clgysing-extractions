Based on the sources, specifically the **Cross-Branch Awareness Document** draft, here is the complete full text of the template. While the source draft uses the placeholder `TPL-0XX`, I have applied the identifier `TPL-016` as requested in your query.\

# TPL-016: CROSS-BRANCH AWARENESS DOCUMENT\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-016\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Provides a shared reference for projects with multiple active branches. Ensures every session ... mainline or branch ... has awareness of parallel workstreams without requiring full context on each branch.\
**When to Use:** When a project has two or more active branches. Create when the second branch is established; update at natural checkpoints throughout the project.\
**Where to Store:** Project Knowledge (alongside Phase Protocol), so that every session has access without explicit upload.\
**Cross-reference:** Section 12.3.7 (Cross-Branch Awareness Document), Section 12.3 (Branch Management)\
\

\
### INSTRUCTIONS\
\
This document is a living reference maintained throughout a project's branching lifecycle. It is stored in Project Knowledge so that every AI instance ... mainline or branch ... can access it as part of the mandatory first action.\
\
**UPDATE TRIGGERS:**\
*   A new branch is created\
*   A branch completes, pauses, or is abandoned\
*   Inter-branch dependencies change\
*   An integration session occurs\
*   Significant scope changes in any branch\
*   Periodically during long-running parallel work (weekly recommended)\
\
**WRITING PRINCIPLES:**\
*   **Keep entries concise** ... this is an awareness tool, not a comprehensive record. 2-3 sentences per branch objective is sufficient.\
*   **Focus on what other sessions need to know**, not branch-internal details.\
*   **Flag coordination needs prominently** ... these are the items most likely to cause problems if missed.\
\
**FILE NAMING:**\
`[PROJECT]_cross-branch-awareness.txt`\
Example: `GOV-AIPM_cross-branc< 2026/02/13 00:54:50.000917651  length=3936 from=8693 to=12628
h-awareness.txt`\
\
*This is a single file per project, updated in place (not versioned per session like bootstraps or session logs).*\

\
### CROSS-BRANCH AWARENESS DOCUMENT TEMPLATE\
\
**Project:** [Project Name ... Project Code]\
**Last Updated:** [Date ... Session ###]\
**Active Branches:** [Count]\
\
#### ACTIVE BRANCHES REGISTER\
\
| Branch Handle | Full Name | Status | Created |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| [HANDLE] | [Descriptive branch name] | Active | Session ## |\
| [HANDLE] | [Descriptive branch name] | Active | Session ## |\
| [HANDLE] | [Descriptive branch name] | Paused | Session ## |\
\
*Status values: Active / Paused / Integrating / Complete / Abandoned*\
\
#### BRANCH OBJECTIVES\
\
**[HANDLE]: [Branch Name]**\
*   **Objective:** [2-3 sentences: what this branch is working on and what it will produce.]\
*   **Expected Deliverables:** [List of key outputs]\
*   **Estimated Timeline:** [Sessions remaining or target completion]\
*   **Notebook:** [Branch adjunct notebook name and ID]\
\
**[HANDLE]: [Branch Name]**\
*   **Objective:** [...]\
*   **Expected Deliverables:** [...]\
*   **Estimated Timeline:** [...]\
*   **Notebook:** [...]\
\
*[Repeat for each active branch]*\
\
#### INTER-BRANCH DEPENDENCIES\
\
*[List any dependencies between branches or between branches and the mainline. If no dependencies exist, state \"No active inter-branch dependencies.\"]*\
\
| Dependency | From | To | Status |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| [What is needed] | [Branch/Main] | [Branch/Main] | [Active/Resolved/Blocked] |\
\
**Notes:**\
[Any additional context about dependencies ... timing constraints, workarounds, escalation needs.]\
\
#### COORDINATION NEEDS\
\
*[Specific items requiring cross-branch attention. These are action items or awareness items that could cause problems if missed.]*\
\
*   [Coordination item ... e.g., \"SECRES branch evaluating encryption approach ... TOOLINT branch should not commit to a TLS implementation until SECRES concludes.\"]\
*   [Coordination item]\
*   *[If none: \"No active coordination needs.\"]*\
\
#### RECENT UPDATES\
\
*[Brief log of significant branch events since the last update. Most recent first.]*\
\
*   **[Date ... Session ###]:** [Event description ... e.g., \"SECRES branch completed Phase 1. Findings F-14 through F-19 uploaded to main notebook. Integration session planned for Session 042.\"]\
*   **[Date ... Session ###]:** [Event description]\
*   **[Date ... Session ###]:** [Event description]\
\
#### COMPLETED / ARCHIVED BRANCHES\
\
*[Branches that have completed their work and been integrated, or that have been abandoned. Maintained for project history.]*\
\
| Branch Handle | Outcome | Integrated In | Date |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| [HANDLE] | [Completed / Abandoned] | Session ### | [Date] |\
\

\
### TEMPLATE NOTES\
\
*   **Design Rationale:** This template prioritizes scanability. A session AI should be able to read the document in under 30 seconds and understand how many branches are active, what each is doing, and whether any coordination needs affect its own work.\
*   **Project Knowledge Storage:** Storing this document in Project Knowledge means every session automatically has access. The Phase Protocol's mandatory first action review naturally pairs with awareness document review for projects with active branches.\
*   **Single File:** Unlike session-specific artifacts, this is updated in place to ensure there is always exactly one current version.\
*   **Relationship to other templates:**\
    *   **TPL-0XX (Branch Startup File):** Update this document when a Startup File is generated.\
    *   **TPL-002 (Bootstrap):** Mainline bootstraps should reference this document.\
    *   **TPL-005 (Session Log):** Integration sessions should log updates to this document. [1] [2] [3]
