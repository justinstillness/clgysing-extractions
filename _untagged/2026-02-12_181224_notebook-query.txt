**Omniology**\
*   **Definition:** The foundational meta-framework described as an attempt to understand the self, the nature of reality, and the purpose of life [1, 2]. It explores how the pursuit of truth in all forms can improve human existence across all scales, from family life to the organization of civilization itself [3, 4].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"At the core of everything I do is what I call Omniology...an attempt to understand myself, the nature of reality, the purpose of life, and how the understanding of truth in all its forms can improve everything from living with your family to running a business to organizing civilization itself.\" [1]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Cultology, Omniological Approach\
\
**The Omniological Approach (Methodology)**\
*   **Definition:** A research methodology that requires understanding a subject from multiple angles and modeling it within personal conceptual frameworks to build \"intrinsic knowledge\" [5, 6]. It prioritizes integrating domains to reason intrinsically rather than relying on authoritative statements or surface-level explanations [7, 8].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The method I use... requires understanding a subject from as many angles as possible, modeling it within my own conceptual frameworks (building intrinsic knowledge), and then integrating it with other domains until I can reason about it intrinsically...\" [5]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Intrinsic Knowledge, Pedagogical Spiral Staircase\
\
**Intrinsic Knowledge**\
*   **Definition:** Deep understanding generated by modeling subjects within one's own internal frameworks and integrating them across domains [7, 9]. It is contrasted with \"extrinsic knowledge\" (reliance on external authority) and allows for independent reasoning [10].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"...modeling it within my own conceptual frameworks (building intrinsic knowledge), and then integrating it with other domains until I can reason about it intrinsically rather than relying on authoritative statements...\" [9]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Omniological Approach, Extrinsic Knowledge\
\
**Cultology**\
*   **Definition:** A \"unified field theory\" for analyzing the mechanics of relationships, power, and belief systems across all scales of human activity [11, 12]. Described as the \"pathology of Omniology,\" it investigates how social systems (groups, families, nations) become corrupted, hijack human potential, and obstruct the flow of truth [11, 13].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"Cultology is the name I gave the project that serves as a unified field theory for analyzing the mechanics of relationships, power, and belief systems across all scales of human activity.\" [11]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Omniology, Parasitic Modality, Macro-cult\
\
**The Cultology Thesis**\
*   **Definition:** The core diagnostic criterion of the framework, stating that any system interrupting the natural flow of truth and growth is inherently cult-like and parasitic [14, 15].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The core thesis is simple: any system that interrupts the natural flow of truth and growth is cult-like, and therefore parasitic.\" [16]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Parasitic Systems, Cultology\
\
**The Parasitic Modality (Parasitic Systems)**\
*   **Definition:** A social order defined by its reliance on extrinsic knowledge, rigid beliefs, and social pressure to suppress inquiry [17, 18]. These systems hijack human potential...turning people into engines of labor and extraction...and function as \"counterfeit transcendence mechanisms\" that replace authentic purpose with surrogate identities [17, 19].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"A cult is defined not by size or ritual, but by its reliance on extrinsic knowledge... This epistemic closure (rigid dogmatic thinking) suppresses the human drive for inquiry and leads to the parasitic extraction of benefits and energy.\" [17]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Symbiotic Modality, Epistemic Closure, Counterfeit Transcendence Mechanism\
\
**The Symbiotic Modality (Symbiotic Systems)**\
*   **Definition:** The positive counterpart to parasitic systems; truth-centered structures that cultivate the \"intrinsic path\" [20, 21]. These systems are defined by the flourishing of human relationships marked by freedom, honesty, creativity, and mutual benefit, empowering individuals through discernment rather than control [20, 22].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The opposite of a cult is a symbiotic system. These systems are truth-centered and cultivate what I call the intrinsic path... Symbiosis is defined by the full flourishing of human relationships into their ideal state...\" [20]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Parasitic Modality, Intrinsic Path\
\
**Macro-Cult (Distributed Cultic Architecture)**\
*   **Definition:** The application of Cultology to the civilizational scale, arguing that modern civilization itself functions as an advanced parasitic system [23, 24]. It operates as a \"distributed cultic architecture\" across families, businesses, governments, and global institutions [23, 25].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The series argues that modern civilization is itself a macro-cult (an advanced parasitic system), functioning as a distributed cultic architecture that operates across families, businesses, governments, and global institutions.\" [23]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Cultology, Parasitic Modality\
\
**The Four Intimacies**\
*   **Definition:** A model defining the total field of human interaction and value exchange: Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Spiritual [26, 27]. Intellectual intimacy is identified as the \"keystone and immune system\" for the others; cults systematically corrupt these intimacies to create dependency [26].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The Four Intimacies define the total field of human interaction and value exchange: Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Spiritual. Intellectual intimacy is the keystone and immune system for the others.\" [26]\

Cultology, Parasitic Modality\
\
**Ontology of Being & The Corruption Cascade**\
*   **Definition:** A structural model of the human being (Personality ... Soul ... Mind ... Emotion ... Physical Expression) [28, 29]. Parasitic systems execute a \"corruption cascade\" by hijacking the core personality spark and inverting this value system [28, 30].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"Ontology of Being describes the structure of being from Personality ... Soul ... Mind ... Emotion ... Physical Expression. Cults execute what I call a corruption cascade, hijacking the core personality spark and inverting the entire value system.\" [28]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Cultology, Parasitic Modality\
\
**Contractual Formalism**\
*   **Definition:** An analytical model viewing all relationships as energetic, epistemic, and moral contracts [31, 32]. Symbiotic systems rely on \"honorable contracts\" (mutual, transparent, revocable), while cults utilize \"counterfeit contracts\" that hollow out genuine consent [31, 32].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"Contractual Formalism recognizes that all relationships are energetic, epistemic, and moral contracts. Symbiotic systems rely on honorable contracts... while cults use counterfeit contracts that hollow out genuine consent.\" [31]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Symbiotic Modality, Parasitic Modality\
\
**Epistemic Closure**\
*   **Definition:** Rigid, dogmatic thinking that suppresses the human drive for inquiry [17, 33]. It is a primary mechanism used by parasitic systems to maintain control and prevent the development of intrinsic knowledge [17].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"This epistemic closure (rigid dogmatic thinking) suppresses the human drive for inquiry and leads to the parasitic extraction of benefits and energy.\" [17]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Parasitic Modality, Extrinsic Knowledge\
\
**Technocratic Plantation (The Trojan Horse)**\
*   **Definition:** A metaphor for modern parasitic civilization, where material conveniences and quality-of-life improvements act as the \"shell of a Trojan horse\" [34, 35]. These benefits conceal a \"toxic payload\" of control and dependency, leading populations to confuse the \"meager benefits of their free-range plantation\" with actual freedom [34, 36].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"This plantation adorns itself in modern conveniences... These benefits act as the shell of a Trojan horse, concealing the much more toxic and freedom-destroying payload of the parasitic vision.\" [34]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Macro-Cult, Free-range Plantation\
\
**Agenda 47 Explained (Symbiotic Transformation Hypothesis)**\
*   **Definition:** A specific application of the Cultology framework to contemporary politics, testing the hypothesis that Donald Trump may represent the \"public face of an elite group attempting to transform society from parasitic to symbiotic\" [37, 38]. This is framed as a hypothesis rather than political advocacy, acknowledging the uncertainty that he could alternatively represent a competing parasitic group [39, 40].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"Agenda 47 Explained... is designed to look at much of the same foundational research, but through a different lens: the hypothesis that Donald Trump might represent...though we cannot know for certain...the public face of an elite group attempting to transform society from parasitic to symbiotic.\" [37]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Cultology, Symbiotic Modality, Intellectual Honesty\
\
**Pedagogical Spiral Staircase**\
*   **Definition:** A content delivery method designed to bridge the gap between deep theoretical frameworks and accessibility [41, 42]. It involves introducing concepts accessibly and then deepening them recursively (\"layer after layer\") so readers of all levels find value [41].\
*   **Key Quote:** \"The pedagogical spiral staircase approach I use allows me to introduce concepts accessibly and then deepen them recursively (layer after layer), so that readers at different levels of familiarity can all find value.\" [41]\
*   **Related Concepts:** Omniological Approach
