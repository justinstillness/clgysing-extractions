Based on the drafting documents for v1.0.8, the Branch Startup File is a new template designed to initialize parallel workstreams. While the draft files currently label it as **TPL-0XX** pending final numbering, the content matches your request for the Branch Startup File template.\
\
Here is the complete full text of the template from the source materials.\
\
***\
\
### **TPL-0XX: BRANCH STARTUP FILE**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX [Draft Assignment]\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Provides the context packet for initializing a new branch workstream. Functions as a specialized Bootstrap for branch creation, containing inherited project context, branch scope, and mini-rooting questions to establish the branch's foundation.\
**When to Use:** When creating a new branch from a mainline session or planning session.\
**Cross-reference:** Section 12.3 (Branch Management), Section 12.3.3 (Branch Creation Process), TPL-002 (Bootstrap Template)\
\
---\
\
#### **INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
Generate this Startup File in the mainline session when the decision to branch has been made. The file provides everything the new branch's AI instance needs to orient and begin work.\
\
The Startup File is a specialized derivative of the Bootstrap (TPL-002). It shares the Bootstrap's function ... context transfer to a new AI instance ... but is structured for branch initialization rather than session continuation. Key differences:\
*   Includes mini-rooting questions (a Bootstrap assumes rooting is already complete)\
*   Specifies the relationship to the mainline (a Bootstrap assumes continuity within a single workstream)\
*   May specify Phase Protocol modifications (a Bootstrap references the existing Phase Protocol as-is)\
\
**WRITING PRINCIPLES:**\
Write for an AI that has no memory of the parent project. Be explicit about what the branch inherits, what it does not, and what it needs to establish on its own. Include enough mainline context to orient, but not so much that it overwhelms the branch's specific scope.\
\
The user will provide this file to the branch AI along with this manual (if the branch AI needs AIPM framework orientation). The branch AI reviews the Startup File and conducts the mini-rooting cycle before beginning any substantive work.\
\
**FILE NAMING:**\
`[###]_branch-startup_[branch-handle].txt`\
Example: `001_branch-startup_SECRES.txt`\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
The mainline AI generates this file when instructed: \"Generate a bran< 2026/02/13 00:54:22.000115190  length=8192 from=18351 to=26542
ch startup file for [purpose]\" or \"Spin up a branch for [scope].\"\

\
1.  **SCOPE CONFIRMATION:** The branch objectives above are [confirmed / need adjustment]. Any refinements?\
2.  **MAINLINE CONNECTION:** How tightly coupled is this branch to mainline progress? Does the mainline depend on branch outputs, or can they proceed independently?\
3.  **PHASE PROTOCOL REVIEW:** Having reviewed the inherited Phase Protocol, do any behaviors need modification for this branch's work? (e.g., different methodology, different output standards, different coordination requirements)\
4.  **BRANCH STRUCTURE:** Is this a single-phase branch (execute and integrate) or multi-phase (requiring its own phase transitions)?\
5.  **CONVENTIONS CONFIRMATION:** Will this branch use the same naming conventions, file classes, and artifact templates as the mainline? Any branch-specific conventions needed?\

\
#### **TEMPLATE NOTES**\
\
**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\
The Branch Startup File is structurally parallel to the Bootstrap (TPL-002) but adapted for branch initialization. The mini-rooting section is the key differentiator ... it provides the abbreviated foundation-building that branches need before execution.\
\
**DECISION AND FINDING INDEX APPROACHES:**\
*   **Option A ... Branch-Specific:** `D-[###]-BR-001`, `D-[###]-BR-002`, etc. This clearly identifies which decisions are branch-specific. Recommended for branches with significant independent decision-making.\
*   **Option B ... Continuing Mainline:** Continue the mainline's `D-###` sequence. Simpler, but branch decisions are interleaved with mainline decisions in the project-wide log. Recommended for tightly coupled branches that will integrate quickly.\
\
Finding indexes always continue the project-wide `F-##` sequence regardless of approach, since findings are project-level knowledge regardless of which branch discovered them.\
\
**RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TEMPLATES:**\
*   **TPL-002 (Bootstrap):** The Branch Startup File is a specialized derivative. After the first branch session, subsequent branch sessions use standard TPL-002 bootstraps.\
*   **TPL-0XX (Cross-Branch Awareness Document):** The branch should be registered in the awareness document when the Startup File is generated.\
*   **TPL-001 (Project Initiation Form):** The Startup File is analogous to TPL-001 at the branch level ... both structure the foundation-building process for a new workstream.
