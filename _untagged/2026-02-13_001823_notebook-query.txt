Based on the sources, the Findings Report template is currently designated with the placeholder **TPL-0XX** in the draft artifacts (specifically in `DRAFT_TPL-0XX_Findings-Report.txt` and `GOV-AIPM_v1_0_8_Volume-3a_Canonical-Artifacts.txt`).\
\
Here is the complete full text of the Findings Report template as defined in the source material.\
\
***\
\
**TPL-0XX: FINDINGS REPORT**\
\
**Template ID:** GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Purpose:** Structured capture of empirical discoveries organized by topic. Preserves observations, evidence, and implications in a format designed for high queryability and evidence-to-decision tracing.\
**When to Use:** During or after sessions involving research, exploration, evaluation, testing, or any work producing empirical observations that warrant structured capture.\
**Cross-reference:** Section 5.6 (Findings Reports), Section 5.3 (Decision Logs), Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity)\
\
---\
\
### **INSTRUCTIONS**\
\
Complete a Findings Report when a session produces empirical discoveries that go beyond routine execution. The report captures what was observed, what evidence supports it, and what it means for the project.\
\
**WHEN TO USE:**\
*   Research or exploration sessions\
*   Evaluation, testing, or validation sessions\
*   Field testing or beta testing sessions\
*   Any session producing significant empirical observations\
\
**WHEN NOT NEEDED:**\
*   Pure execution sessions (drafting, formatting, assembly)\
*   Administrative sessions (file organization, project setup)\
*   Sessions where no empirical observations emerged\
\
The AI may propose Findings Report generation mid-session when it recognizes a pattern of empirical discovery. The user approves, defers to closeout, or declines.\
\
**INDEXING:**\
Finding IDs (F-##) accumulate across the entire project and never reset. Check the prior Findings Report or Session Log for the last used F-## number. If this is the project's first Findings Report, begin at F-01.\
\
**FILE NAMING:**\
`[###]_findings.txt` or `[###]_findings_[topic].txt`\
Examples: `012_findings.txt`, `032_findings_beta-test-review.txt`\
\
**DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:**\
The AI generates this template as part of the session workflow. Say: \"Let's capture findings\" or \"Start a Findings Report\" to initiate. The AI may also propose generation proactively.\
\
**Tips:**\
*   Write discoveries as standalone statements ... a reader should understand each finding without additional context\
*   Be specific in evidence ... reference sessions, response indexes, or external sources\
*   Separate observation (Discovery) from interpretation (Impact)\
*   Use standard verdicts where they fit; create custom verdicts when needed\

\
### **TEMPLATE NOTES**\
\
**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\
The template prioritizes queryability. Each finding is a self-contained block with a unique ID, making it highly effective as a notebook source. A query for \"F-14\" or \"findings about token exhaustion\" returns precisely structured results.\
\
The five-field schema separates observation from interpretation:\
*   **Discovery** and **Evidence** are empirical (what was seen)\
*   **Impact/Implication** is analytical (what it means)\
*   **Status/Verdict** is evaluative (what to do about it)\
\
This separation prevents a common failure mode where observations are conflated with conclusions, making it difficult to re-evaluate findings when project context changes.\
\
**CUMULATIVE INDEX:**\
The cumulative index at the bottom of each report serves two purposes:\
1.  Running directory of all project findings for quick reference\
2.  High-value notebook source ... a single document that enables targeted retrieval across the entire findings corpus\
\
For long-running projects, the cumulative index ma< 2026/02/13 00:18:54.000225207  length=1001 from=16885 to=17885
y be maintained as a separate standalone file (`[PROJECT]_cumulative-findings-index.txt`) to avoid excessive growth within individual reports. In this case, individual reports may omit the cumulative index section and cross-reference the standalone file.\
\
**STANDARD VERDICTS:**\
\
| Verdict | Meaning |\
| :--- | :--- |\
| **VALIDATED** | Confirms an approach, tool, or hypothesis |\
| **GAP IDENTIFIED** | Reveals a missing capability or content |\
| **REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING** | Promising but inconclusive |\
| **CONTRADICTS** | Contradicts a prior assumption or approach |\
| **INFORMS DECISION** | Provides evidence for a pending choice |\
| **NOTED** | Recorded for reference, no immediate action |\
\
Custom verdicts are acceptable when standard options do not fit the finding's nature. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]
