SECTION 1: MASTER THESIS & SUB-THESES
================================================================================

MASTER THESIS (as articulated in transcript):
There exists an inherent physics of relationships — broadly called trust and
contract — that is deeper than conventionally understood. By properly
apprehending money (one of the least understood phenomena on the planet) as
a surface indicator of this deeper physics, one can reveal the whole truth of
the civilizational game: that symbiosis is not an arbitrary moral preference
but an objective law of optimization, applicable from the dyad to the
civilization to all of creation.
