TPL-0XX: ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST

Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Standard structure for the Alignment Turn at session start.
         Ensures shared understanding of scope, materials, workflow, and
         expected outputs before substantive work begins.
When to Use: At the start of every continuation session, after the AI
             has reviewed the Phase Protocol and acknowledged the Bootstrap.

Cross-reference: Section 4.3.1.1 (The Alignment Turn), Section 4.3.1
(Session Initiation)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI generates this checklist proactively as part of the session
initiation sequence. The user does not need to request it — the
Alignment Turn is a mandatory step in the continuation protocol.

The checklist should be adapted to match session complexity:
- Simple continuation: Concise checklist covering scope and materials
- Complex multi-deliverable session: Thorough checklist with detailed
  workflow and dependency verification

The AI draws checklist content from:
- The Bootstrap (primary source for scope, materials, and priorities)
- User input at session start (adjustments, additions, clarifications)
- Phase Protocol (behavioral context and standing requirements)

The user reviews the checklist and responds with confirmation, corrections,
or additional context. Work proceeds only after explicit user confirmation.

DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:
The AI generates this automatically. If the AI omits the alignment turn,
the user can prompt: "Let's do the alignment checklist" or "Run through
TPL-0XX before we start."

ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST — Session [###]
====================================

SCOPE:
[What this session aims to accomplish — stated as specific, assessable
objectives derived from the Bootstrap and user input]

- Objective 1: _______________________________________________________________
- Objective 2: _______________________________________________________________
- Objective 3 (if applicable): _______________________________________________

MATERIALS:
[What is confirmed present and what is still needed]

Confirmed:
- [ ] [Material 1 — e.g., "Bootstrap reviewed and acknowledged"]
- [ ] [Material 2 — e.g., "Drafting Plan uploaded"]
- [ ] [Material 3 — e.g., "Notebook access confirmed"]

Still Needed:
- [ ] [Material — e.g., "Findings document not yet uploaded"]
- [ ] [Material — or "None — all materials present"]

WORKFLOW:
[Proposed sequence of work for the session, including priority ordering
and natural breakpoints]

1. [First work block]
2. [Second work block]
3. [Continue as needed]
4. Closeout

EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
[Deliverables and artifacts this session should produce]

- [Output 1 — e.g., "Revised Section 4.3 draft"]
- [Output 2 — e.g., "Revised TPL-002 template"]
- [Output 3]
- Session Log and Bootstrap (standard closeout artifacts)

GAPS OR QUESTIONS:
[Anything unclear, potentially conflicting, or requiring user input
before work begins]

- [Question 1 — e.g., "Bootstrap references Session A drafts for
  cross-reference — are those uploaded?"]
- [Question 2 — or "No gaps identified — ready to proceed"]

TEMPLATE NOTES
================================================================================

DESIGN RATIONALE:

This template is intentionally lightweight. The Alignment Turn should
feel like a brief, productive handshake — not a bureaucratic gate. The
checklist verifies shared understanding without consuming excessive
tokens.

The template captures the minimum viable alignment check. The AI should
expand depth where complexity warrants it (e.g., a session with 8
deliverables needs more detailed workflow planning than a session with
1), but the basic structure remains consistent.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TEMPLATES:

The Alignment Checklist is generated by the AI, not completed by the
user. It draws from:
- TPL-002 (Bootstrap) — provides the raw material for scope, materials,
  and priorities
- Phase Protocol — provides behavioral context

It feeds into:
- TPL-005 (Session Log) — the session objective recorded in the log
  should match the confirmed alignment scope
- TPL-003 (Session Closeout Checklist) — the loose ends assessment at
  closeout references back to the alignment scope to identify divergences
