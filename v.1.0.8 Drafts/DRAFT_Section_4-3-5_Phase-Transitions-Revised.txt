================================================================================

NOTE ON SESSION A INTEGRATION:

This draft supersedes Session A Integration Point 2
(DRAFT_Integration-Points_Phase-Protocol.txt), which established a stub
for Phase Protocol evaluation within phase transitions. That stub's
content — the evaluation questions and carry-forward documentation — is
fully incorporated into Step 6 of the 8-step process below.

This draft also supersedes the existing v1.0.7 Section 4.3.5 content.
The existing content (recognition criteria, upload requirements, AI and
user responsibilities, horizon view, checklist) is incorporated into the
new structure rather than discarded.

NOTE ON SESSION B CONTEXT:

The Session B revision of Section 4.3 (DRAFT_Section_4-3_Session-
Lifecycle-Revised.txt) explicitly retained 4.3.5 for Session E revision.
This draft provides that revision. Section 4.3.5.2.1 (Token
Considerations for Phase Transitions) content is retained and updated
within the new structure.

4.3.5 Phase Transition Sessions
---------------------------------

Phase transitions are not ordinary session boundaries. They are the
zero-crossings in the project's sine wave rhythm — strategic pauses
between execution peaks where the project consolidates completed work
and prepares for the next phase. Understanding this character is
essential: transition sessions are planning-heavy and execution-light
by design, not because something has stalled.

The sine wave model (introduced in Section 2.5.1) visualizes this
rhythm:

- Peaks represent active phase work — high-output execution sessions
  where deliverables are produced and the project advances.
- Zero-crossings represent transition work — consolidation, planning,
  protocol revision, and preparation for the next execution peak.
- The first zero-crossing is rooting (Phase 0), which occurs before the
  first peak. Subsequent zero-crossings are the phase transitions
  described in this section.

Transition sessions consume their token budget primarily on planning,
scoping, and administrative work rather than content production. Users
and AI coordinators should expect this character and not interpret it
as unproductive. The investment in a thorough transition pays dividends
throughout the next execution phase.


4.3.5.1 Recognizing Phase Boundaries
--------------------------------------

Phase transitions occur when:

- Planned phase deliverables are complete or substantially complete
- The project reaches a natural inflection point (e.g., research
  complete, moving to execution; drafting complete, moving to review)
- Work type shifts significantly enough that AI behaviors, methodology,
  or coordination patterns need to change
- Phase exit criteria (as defined in the Project Guide or Phase
  Protocol) are met
- The Bootstrap explicitly indicates phase completion

Not every significant milestone is a phase boundary. Phases are major
divisions of work with distinct objectives and behavioral requirements.
If you are unsure whether a transition has occurred, consult the Project
Guide — the phase structure defined there is authoritative.

AI BEHAVIORAL NOTE: When the AI recognizes a phase boundary, it
explicitly names it: "We've completed Phase X. Before beginning Phase Y,
let's conduct the phase transition process." The AI should not treat
phase transitions as ordinary sessions or proceed into new phase work
without the transition protocol.

Cross-reference: Section 2.7.3 details the AI's Phase Transition
Orientation Duty.


4.3.5.2 The 8-Step Phase Transition Process
---------------------------------------------

The phase transition process follows eight steps that move from
assessment of completed work through preparation for upcoming work. The
steps are sequential — each builds on the prior step's output.

STEP 1 — ASSESS.

Review the current position and readiness for transition:
- Are phase exit criteria met? (Verify against the Project Guide or
  Phase Protocol's exit criteria for the current phase.)
- What is the state of each deliverable? (Complete, substantially
  complete, or partially complete?)
- Are there outstanding items that must be resolved before the
  transition, or can they carry forward?

If exit criteria are not met, the transition may be premature. The AI
should flag this: "Phase exit criteria X and Y are not yet met. Should
we continue the current phase, or proceed with the transition noting
these as incomplete?"

STEP 2 — CONSOLIDATE.

Gather the project record from the completed phase:
- Session Logs from all sessions in the phase
- Session Fidelity Reports (embedded in Session Logs)
- Decision Log entries made during the phase
- Findings Reports generated during the phase
- Backlog Register (current state)
- Any other phase-specific artifacts

For projects using notebook connectivity, the notebook provides access
to the full phase record without requiring every document to be uploaded
to the session. The AI may query the notebook for specific consolidation
needs rather than loading all documents.

STEP 3 — SYNTHESIZE.

Extract the essential knowledge from the completed phase using
husk-vs-coconut filtering.

THE HUSK VS. COCONUT PRINCIPLE:

Phase transitions require carrying forward what matters and leaving
behind what does not. A project's conversational history accumulates
both essential knowledge (coconut) and ephemeral content (husk). The
synthesis step separates them.

COCONUT — Keep and carry forward:
- Finalized decisions and their rationale
- Crystallized conclusions and validated findings
- Validated methodologies and confirmed approaches
- Confirmed scope boundaries and constraints
- Terminology, conventions, and standards established
- Lessons learned that affect future work
- Dependencies and integration points

HUSK — Leave behind:
- Conversational filler and exploratory tangents
- Rejected hypotheses and superseded options
- Unanswered questions that were resolved later
- Intermediate drafts that were replaced by final versions
- Process discussion that informed decisions now captured elsewhere
- Speculative analysis that did not lead to conclusions

The synthesis output is a concise summary of what the completed phase
accomplished and what knowledge persists into the next phase. This
summary informs the Bootstrap and provides context for Phase Protocol
evaluation.

The husk-vs-coconut principle also applies to the Bootstrap itself.
Phase transition bootstraps should carry forward coconut content and
shed husk content that accumulated in session-to-session bootstraps
during the phase. This is a natural decluttering point.

STEP 4 — REVIEW DEFERRED ITEMS.

Assess the Backlog Register and any items deferred during the completed
phase:
- Which deferred items belong in the upcoming phase?
- Which should remain deferred to later phases?
- Which are no longer relevant and should be retired?
- Have any deferred items become urgent due to phase completion?

If the project uses the Insight Capture Protocol (Section 5.9.7), review
captured items that were routed to "future phase" during the completed
phase. The transition is the natural evaluation point for these items.

Cross-reference: Section 5.9.8 (Backlog Evaluation Sessions) provides
the framework for systematic backlog review.

STEP 5 — DEFINE UPCOMING PHASE SCOPE.

Establish boundaries for the next execution phase:
- Phase objectives: What will this phase accomplish?
- Deliverables: What tangible outputs will it produce?
- Success criteria: How will we know the phase is complete?
- Estimated sessions: How many sessions should this phase require?
- Required materials: What documents, tools, or external inputs are
  needed?
- Constraints: Timeline, resources, dependencies on other workstreams

This is the Phase Execution Brief — a forward-looking plan for the
upcoming phase. The AI generates this from the Project Guide's phase
structure (which defined the phase at project inception) updated by
current project state and any scope adjustments from the completed
phase.

THE HORIZON VIEW:

As part of scope definition, the AI provides a horizon view — a
deliberate pause to see both backward and forward:

What We've Accomplished: Summary of the completed phase's deliverables,
key decisions, and how the project has evolved through the phase.

Where We're Going: Overview of the upcoming phase objectives, expected
work, and how this phase connects to project completion.

The horizon view prevents accumulating drift. When deep in execution,
it is easy to lose sight of the larger trajectory. Phase transitions
force a return to strategic visibility — verifying that the project
remains on course and that upcoming work still serves the original
objectives.

The horizon view is not optional overhead — it is the mechanism that
keeps multi-phase projects coherent across what may be weeks or months
of work.

STEP 6 — EVALUATE AND UPDATE THE PHASE PROTOCOL.

At every phase transition, the Phase Protocol must be explicitly
evaluated. This evaluation is mandatory — even if the conclusion is
that no changes are needed, the evaluation must occur and the conclusion
must be documented.

EVALUATION QUESTIONS:

- Do AI behaviors need to change for the upcoming phase? (e.g., shifting
  from research behaviors to drafting behaviors, from exploration to
  execution)
- Has the methodology (Layer 2) shifted? (e.g., moving from a research
  methodology to a writing methodology)
- Have project-specific parameters (Layer 3) changed? (e.g., new
  deliverable formats, new terminology, new constraints)
- Have addenda accumulated during the completed phase that warrant a
  clean redraft? (Guideline: more than three addenda suggests a
  redraft.)
- Are there behavioral lessons from the completed phase to incorporate?
  (e.g., "the AI kept forgetting X" → add explicit instruction for X)

IF NO CHANGES NEEDED: The existing Phase Protocol carries forward with
a version note confirming it was reviewed at the transition and found
adequate. Document the evaluation in the transition session's Session
Log.

IF CHANGES NEEDED: The AI redrafts the Phase Protocol for the upcoming
phase. The redraft process:

1. Begin with the existing Phase Protocol as a baseline
2. Layer 1 (AIPM Framework Behaviors): Update if any framework-level
   behaviors need adjustment (rare — usually stable)
3. Layer 2 (Methodology Context): Update if the upcoming phase uses a
   different methodology or approach than the completed phase
4. Layer 3 (Project-Specific Context): Update for new phase objectives,
   deliverables, conventions, and any project-specific behavioral
   requirements
5. Incorporate any addenda from the completed phase that should become
   permanent
6. Remove any behavioral guidance specific to the completed phase that
   no longer applies
7. User reviews and approves the new Phase Protocol
8. Store the new Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge; archive the
   prior version

VERSION DISCIPLINE:
- New phase → new major version (v1.0 → v2.0)
- The new version's naming follows the convention in Section 5.2.9

Cross-reference: Section 5.2.5 details the Phase Protocol lifecycle.
Section 5.2.6 covers the addendum pattern.

STEP 7 — UPDATE ROLLING RECORDS.

Consolidate and update the project's rolling records:

- Decision Log: Verify all phase decisions are captured with proper
  numbering and rationale. The consolidated decision record should
  reflect coconut content only — the decisions themselves and their
  rationale, not the conversational context in which they were made.

- Terminology and Conventions: If the project maintains a terminology
  guide or conventions document, update it with any new terms or
  standards established during the completed phase.

- Cross-Reference Map: If the project maintains cross-reference maps
  between documents, artifacts, or sections, verify they are current.

- Project Roadmap (TPL-010): Mark the completed phase as done. Update
  the current position indicator. Verify that the upcoming phase
  definition still matches the Project Guide.

- Project Guide: If scope changed materially during the completed phase,
  update the Project Guide to reflect the current state. The Project
  Guide should always reflect reality — not the original plan if the
  plan has evolved.

STEP 8 — GENERATE TRANSITION ARTIFACTS.

Produce the artifacts that bridge the completed phase to the upcoming
phase:

- Bootstrap for the first session of the new phase. This Bootstrap
  should be a clean document — not a copy of the last session's
  Bootstrap with modifications, but a fresh document reflecting the
  transition synthesis. It carries coconut content from the completed
  phase and forward-looking context for the new phase, including a
  mandatory first action to review the Phase Protocol (new or carried
  forward).

- Transition Summary (optional but recommended for complex projects):
  A brief document capturing the transition's key outputs — what the
  completed phase accomplished, what the upcoming phase will address,
  any decisions made during the transition, and any items carried
  forward or deferred. This is particularly useful when the transition
  itself spans content that the Bootstrap alone cannot capture.

- Updated Phase Protocol (if redrafted in Step 6), stored in Project
  Knowledge.

- Updated Project Roadmap (from Step 7).


4.3.5.3 Phase Transition Upload Requirements
----------------------------------------------

At phase boundaries, provide the AI with strategic context — not just
tactical state:

Project Guide: The authoritative strategic plan. Phase transitions
require returning to strategic context, not just tactical state. The
Project Guide reminds both user and AI of the project's identity and
intended trajectory.

Project Roadmap (TPL-010): Shows the full phase structure, current
position, and what the upcoming phase entails. The roadmap is the
horizon-level view.

Bootstrap from the final session of the prior phase: Carries forward
tactical details and session state.

Phase Protocol (from Project Knowledge): The behavioral governance
document for the completed phase. Needed for the Step 6 evaluation.

Phase-Specific Materials: If the upcoming phase requires reference
materials not previously loaded — research outputs, stakeholder inputs,
revised specifications — include them now.

TOKEN CONSIDERATIONS:

Phase transitions require heavier document loading than typical session
continuations. This increased context consumption warrants explicit
attention:

1. Start a fresh session. Phase transitions should not occur
   mid-session; the prior session should close out cleanly before the
   transition begins.

2. Request a headroom assessment before loading documents. Establish
   baseline capacity to inform loading decisions.

3. Load documents in priority order: Project Guide first, then Roadmap,
   then Bootstrap, then Phase Protocol. This ensures strategic context
   is established before tactical details.

4. If materials are extensive, consider providing summaries rather than
   full documents for reference items that will not require direct
   editing.

5. After loading, confirm remaining headroom before proceeding with
   transition work. Do not assume sufficient capacity remains.

For projects using notebook connectivity, the notebook can supplement
in-session document loading. Rather than uploading the full phase record,
query the notebook for specific consolidation needs during the
transition process. This reserves session tokens for transition
planning rather than document ingestion.

Cross-reference: Section 4.2.2 (Headroom Discipline), Section 4.2.5
(Token Exhaustion Recovery Protocol), Section 10.3 (Notebook
Connectivity).


4.3.5.4 AI Responsibilities at Phase Boundaries
-------------------------------------------------

When recognizing a phase transition, the AI should:

Execute the 8-step transition process (Section 4.3.5.2). The AI leads
the process, presenting each step's outputs for user review and
approval. The process is collaborative — the AI drafts, the user
validates — but the AI is responsible for ensuring no step is skipped.

Name the transition explicitly. The AI should not slide from one phase
to the next without acknowledgment: "We've completed Phase X. Before
beginning Phase Y, let's conduct the phase transition process."

Lead with assessment. Before planning forward, verify that the
completed phase actually met its objectives. Premature transition —
moving on before a phase is truly complete — is a significant failure
mode.

Provide the horizon view. The backward-and-forward summary (Step 5)
orients the user to the project's trajectory. This is particularly
important for long-running projects where the user may have lost
sight of the strategic arc.

Evaluate the Phase Protocol. Step 6 is mandatory. The AI should not
carry the Phase Protocol forward without explicit evaluation, even if
the evaluation concludes that no changes are needed.

Confirm alignment. Phase transitions are natural checkpoints for
verifying that the project remains on its intended trajectory. The AI
should explicitly confirm with the user before proceeding to new phase
work: "Does this phase plan align with your expectations? Ready to
proceed?"


4.3.5.5 User Responsibilities at Phase Boundaries
---------------------------------------------------

Before the transition session:

- Ensure the Project Guide is current. If scope changed during the
  prior phase, update the Guide before the transition session.
- Gather all materials needed for the upcoming phase.
- Review the prior phase's accomplishments and any open issues.
- If using notebook connectivity, verify the notebook is current
  (all transcripts and artifacts from the completed phase uploaded).

During the transition session:

- Provide all required documents (Project Guide, Roadmap, Bootstrap).
- Engage substantively in the transition process — this is a strategic
  conversation, not a formality.
- Review and approve the Phase Protocol evaluation (carry-forward or
  redraft).
- Confirm the phase plan before the AI proceeds with new phase work.
- Explicitly approve the transition: "Ready to proceed with Phase Y."

After the transition session:

- Download all transition artifacts (Bootstrap, updated Roadmap,
  new Phase Protocol if redrafted).
- Store the new or carried-forward Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge.
- Archive the prior phase's Phase Protocol (if superseded).
- Note the phase transition in project records.
- Upload the transition session transcript to the project notebook.

USER ACTION — PHASE PROTOCOL STORAGE:

If the Phase Protocol was redrafted during the transition, the user
must update Project Knowledge: remove or rename the prior version and
store the new version. The Bootstrap for the next session will instruct
the AI to review the Phase Protocol — if the old version remains in
Project Knowledge, the AI will review outdated governance.
