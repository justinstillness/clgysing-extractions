DRAFT — INTEGRATION POINTS FOR PHASE PROTOCOL
================================================================================
Target:     Multiple existing sections in GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT
Drafted:    Session 033
Category:   1 (Phase Protocol) — integration weave
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

These are targeted insertions and modifications to existing manual
sections that create the cross-reference web connecting the Phase Protocol
to every relevant context in the manual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 1: Section 4.3.1 Session Initiation
Location: After the existing "For Continuation (Via Bootstrap)" block
Action: REPLACE the three existing initiation scenarios with enhanced
        versions that incorporate Phase Protocol review
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE EXISTING 4.3.1 CONTENT WITH:

4.3.1 Session Initiation
------------------------

Proper session start establishes productive trajectory. The initiation
sequence varies by session type but always includes behavioral alignment
through the Phase Protocol.

For New Projects (Rooting / Phase 0):
1. Upload this manual (or orient AI to AIPM framework)
2. Describe project objectives and desired outcomes
3. Engage in collaborative rooting process (see Section 2.5.1)
4. Produce Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol
5. Generate Bootstrap for first execution session

Cross-reference: Section 2.5.1 details the full rooting process.

For Continuation (Via Bootstrap):
1. Provide Bootstrap file (and any required attachments)
2. AI executes Bootstrap mandatory first action — typically: review
   Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge and confirm adherence
3. AI acknowledges Bootstrap and confirms understanding of current state
4. AI generates alignment checklist (scope, materials, workflow,
   expected outputs, gaps or questions)
5. User verifies alignment checklist
6. If aligned, work proceeds; if misaligned, adjust before proceeding
7. AI requests and verifies any dependencies noted in Bootstrap

For Branch Sessions:
1. Provide Branch Startup File (see Section [Branch Management])
2. AI reviews inherited Phase Protocol (may be modified for branch)
3. Conduct mini-rooting cycle if this is the branch's first session
4. AI generates alignment checklist specific to branch scope
5. User verifies alignment
6. Establish integration expectations with mainline

The alignment turn at session start (steps 4-6 in the continuation
sequence) is mandatory, not optional. It prevents three failure modes:

- Evaporation: starting work without shared understanding of objectives
- Missing context: beginning without required materials loaded
- Misalignment: working toward different objectives than intended

Cross-reference: Section 5.2 details the Phase Protocol. Section 5.5
details Bootstrap Files.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 2: Section 4.3.5 Phase Transition Sessions
Location: Within the existing phase transition content
Action: ADD Phase Protocol evaluation as a formal step
Note: Full revision of phase transitions is Session E scope; this
      insertion establishes the Phase Protocol reference point
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD TO EXISTING PHASE TRANSITION CONTENT:

Phase Protocol Evaluation:

At every phase transition, the Phase Protocol must be explicitly
evaluated. This is not optional — even if the conclusion is that no
changes are needed, the evaluation must occur and the conclusion must
be documented.

Evaluation questions:
- Do AI behaviors need to change for the upcoming phase?
- Has the methodology (Layer 2) shifted?
- Have project-specific parameters (Layer 3) changed?
- Have addenda accumulated that warrant a clean redraft?
- Are there behavioral lessons from the completed phase to incorporate?

If the answer to any question is yes, the Phase Protocol should be
redrafted for the new phase. If all answers are no, the existing protocol
carries forward with a version note confirming it was reviewed and found
adequate.

Cross-reference: Section 5.2.5 details the Phase Protocol lifecycle
including the redrafting process.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 3: Section 5.1 Project Guide — Enhancement
Location: Section 5.1.2 (Contents) and 5.1.4 (Template Reference)
Action: ADD explicit relationship to Phase Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD TO END OF SECTION 5.1.2 (after the existing contents list):

Relationship to Phase Protocol:

The Project Guide and Phase Protocol are complementary but distinct. The
Project Guide defines the project — its scope, deliverables, phases, and
success criteria. The Phase Protocol governs how work is conducted within
a given phase. Both are created during rooting (Phase 0), but they evolve
on different cadences: the Project Guide changes rarely (only for
material scope changes), while the Phase Protocol may be redrafted at
every phase transition.

The Phase Protocol draws FROM the Project Guide — particularly the phase
structure, deliverable definitions, and project-specific context — to
create phase-appropriate behavioral governance. Changes to the Project
Guide may trigger Phase Protocol review.

Cross-reference: Section 5.2 details the Phase Protocol.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 4: Section 5.5 Bootstrap Files (new number)
Location: Throughout the Bootstrap section
Action: ADD Phase Protocol relationship content + quality enhancement
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD NEW SUBSECTION (after existing Bootstrap Structure, before
Bootstrap Discipline):

5.5.X The Bootstrap-Phase Protocol Relationship
------------------------------------------------

The Bootstrap and Phase Protocol work in tandem to ensure every session
begins with both context (Bootstrap) and behavioral governance (Phase
Protocol).

The Bootstrap as Prompt List:

The Bootstrap functions partly as a prompt list — a set of explicit
instructions telling the AI what to do at session start. The most
critical of these instructions is typically the mandatory first action:
reviewing the Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge.

This prompt-list function means the Bootstrap contains two categories of
content:

Dynamic content (changes every session):
- Last session summary and state
- Next actions and priorities
- Open items and questions
- Headroom notes
- Session-specific instructions

Stable content (persists across the phase):
- Instruction to review Phase Protocol
- Notebook connectivity references (IDs and descriptions)
- Recurring behavioral reminders
- Standing instructions that apply to every session
- Decision log continuity (next decision number)

As a project matures, the stable content section of the Bootstrap tends
to grow. This growth is normal and expected. However, if stable content
becomes unwieldy, consider whether some of it should be consolidated
into a Phase Protocol addendum — moving standing behavioral instructions
into the phase-stable document where they more naturally belong.

Behavioral Reminder Section:

Despite Phase Protocol governance, certain behaviors may require explicit
reminders in the Bootstrap. Field testing has shown that some behaviors
are prone to being forgotten or deprioritized even when encoded in the
Phase Protocol:

- Connector transparency (narrating tool calls for transcript
  completeness)
- Specific formatting conventions
- Project-specific naming or numbering schemes

These reminders are not redundant — they serve as reinforcement for
behaviors that are critical but easily dropped. Include them in the
Bootstrap's stable content section.

Cross-reference: Section 5.2 details the Phase Protocol. Section 5.2.4
explains the Bootstrap-Phase Protocol relationship in depth.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 5: Section 5.8 Artifact Relationships (new number)
Location: Within the artifact relationship map
Action: ADD Phase Protocol to the relationship map
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD TO ARTIFACT RELATIONSHIPS:

Phase Protocol Relationships:

The Phase Protocol connects to the artifact ecosystem as follows:

- DRAWS FROM: Project Guide (scope, phases, project context)
- GOVERNS: Session behavior, work product standards, coordination duties
- REFERENCED BY: Bootstrap (mandatory first-action review)
- SUPPLEMENTED BY: Phase Protocol Addenda
- UPDATED AT: Phase transitions
- CREATED DURING: Rooting (Phase 0)
- STORED IN: Project Knowledge
- ARCHIVED TO: /Phase Protocols/Old/ when superseded

The Phase Protocol is the behavioral bridge between the strategic layer
(Project Guide, Project Roadmap) and the tactical layer (Bootstrap,
Session Log, Decision Log). Without it, behavioral expectations must be
re-established every session from scratch or inferred from context —
both of which are unreliable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 6: Section 2.6 The Orientation Principle
Location: Section 2.6.2 (The Orientation Templates)
Action: ADD Phase Protocol to the orientation template list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD TO SECTION 2.6.2 (after TPL-002 entry, before TPL-007):

Phase Protocol (stored in Project Knowledge): Phase-level behavioral
orientation. Reviewed at every session start for continuing projects.
Establishes how the AI should behave throughout the current phase —
behavioral standards, methodology, conventions, and coordination duties.
Unlike the templates above, the Phase Protocol is not a form to fill out
but a governance document reviewed for adherence.

UPDATE THE PARAGRAPH FOLLOWING THE TEMPLATE LIST:

These templates and the Phase Protocol are not bureaucratic overhead.
They are orientation instruments — structured ways to establish the shared
understanding that productive work requires.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 7: Section 1.4.6 User Workflow Overview
Location: Within the existing user workflow content
Action: UPDATE to reflect rooting as the entry point for new projects
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Full content of Section 1.4.6 not yet reviewed. The integration
here should ensure that the user workflow overview references:
- Rooting (Phase 0) as the starting process for new projects
- Phase Protocol creation as part of project startup
- The collaborative nature of the rooting process

This integration point should be verified against the actual Section
1.4.6 content during drafting session assembly.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 8: Table of Contents
Location: Lines 99-107 (Section 5 TOC entries)
Action: UPDATE to reflect new section numbering
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE Section 5 TOC entries:

  Section 5: Canonical Project Artifacts
    5.1 Project Guide
    5.2 Phase Protocol
    5.3 Decision Logs
    5.4 Session Logs
    5.5 Bootstrap Files
    5.6 Findings Reports
    5.7 Supporting Artifacts
    5.8 Artifact Relationships
    5.9 Backlog Register
    5.10 Project Closure Report

NOTE: Findings Reports (5.6) is Session D scope — placeholder in TOC
can be established now, with content drafted later.


================================================================================
QUALITY AUDIT NOTES
================================================================================

During research for this drafting session, the following quality
observations were noted for existing manual content:

1. SECTION 5.1 (Project Guide): Adequately detailed. The contents list,
   maintenance rules, and template reference are comprehensive. The main
   enhancement needed is the Phase Protocol relationship paragraph
   (Integration Point 3 above). No other quality issues identified.

2. SECTION 5.4/5.5 (Bootstrap Files — current/new numbering): Reasonably
   detailed in structure and principles. However, the field-tested
   Bootstrap practices have evolved significantly beyond what TPL-002
   currently prescribes. Key gaps:
   - No mention of Phase Protocol review as mandatory first action
   - No concept of stable vs. dynamic Bootstrap content
   - No behavioral reminder section
   - No notebook connectivity references
   - No response index continuity fields
   - Bootstrap Types (Continuation, Branch, Recovery) are defined but
     the Continuation type doesn't reflect current best practice

   RECOMMENDATION: TPL-002 (Bootstrap Template) needs a significant
   revision in Session B to reflect field-tested structure. The current
   template is functional but does not encode the evolved practices that
   make bootstraps most effective. This is a priority quality enhancement.

3. SECTION 4.3.1 (Session Initiation): Currently thin — just brief
   checklists for three scenarios. The replacement content in Integration
   Point 1 above significantly enhances this. Session B will further
   develop the alignment turn protocol.

4. SECTION 2.6 (Orientation Principle): Well-written and conceptually
   strong. Needs only the Phase Protocol addition (Integration Point 6).

5. SECTION 4.3.5 (Phase Transitions): Currently the most robust part of
   the session lifecycle section. The Phase Protocol evaluation addition
   (Integration Point 2) is a natural fit. Full enhancement deferred to
   Session E as planned.
