5.6 FINDINGS REPORTS
---------------------

5.6.1 Definition
-----------------

A Findings Report is a synthesis document that captures empirical
discoveries organized by topic. Unlike Session Logs, which record what
happened chronologically, and Decision Logs, which record choices made,
Findings Reports record what was discovered — observations, test
results, evaluations, and insights extracted from research or
exploration work.

Findings Reports use a dedicated artifact class (FINDINGS) and a
project-wide sequential indexing convention (F-##) that accumulates
across the entire project lifecycle without resetting at session or
phase boundaries.


5.6.2 Purpose
--------------

Findings Reports serve four purposes:

Discovery Preservation. Research and exploration sessions generate
empirical observations that are valuable beyond the session that
produced them. Without a dedicated artifact, these discoveries are
buried in chat transcripts — difficult to locate, impossible to query
systematically, and prone to being lost when conversations grow long.
The Findings Report extracts discoveries from their conversational
context and preserves them as structured, retrievable records.

Evidence-to-Decision Pipeline. Findings provide the evidentiary
foundation that informs project decisions. The directional flow is:
observations produce Findings, Findings inform Decisions. By separating
the discovery record (Findings Report) from the choice record (Decision
Log), the framework maintains a clear chain from evidence to conclusion.
A reviewer can trace any decision back to the findings that supported
it.

Topical Organization. Session Logs answer the question "what happened
on this date?" Findings Reports answer the question "what do we know
about this topic?" This topical organization is particularly valuable
for projects that revisit the same subject areas across multiple
sessions — the Findings Report accumulates knowledge by theme rather
than scattering it across chronological records.

Queryability. Findings Reports are designed for high queryability via
notebook connectivity tools (Section 10.3). Their structured format —
unique IDs, concise discovery statements, explicit evidence, and clear
status verdicts — makes them exceptionally effective as notebook
sources. A query like "show me all findings related to token
exhaustion" returns precise, structured results rather than fragments
of conversation.


5.6.3 Distinction from Other Artifacts
----------------------------------------

Understanding what a Findings Report is NOT clarifies its role:

SESSION LOG (File Class: LOG)
- Organized: Chronologically (by session)
- Records: What happened — activities, outputs, issues
- Indexed by: Session number
- Answers: "What did we do on this date?"

DECISION LOG (File Class: DECISION)
- Organized: Sequentially by decision (D-###)
- Records: What was chosen — rationale, alternatives, implications
- Indexed by: Decision number
- Answers: "What did we decide and why?"

FINDINGS REPORT (File Class: FINDINGS)
- Organized: Topically (by subject area)
- Records: What was discovered — observations, evidence, implications
- Indexed by: Finding number (F-##)
- Answers: "What do we know about this topic?"

The relationship between these artifacts is directional:

  Research produces → Findings (F-##)
  Findings inform → Decisions (D-###)
  Decisions shape → Project execution (logged in Session Logs)

All three artifact types are canonical and complementary. A
well-documented project maintains all three, with each serving its
distinct retrieval purpose.


5.6.4 Indexing Convention
--------------------------

Findings use the F-## indexing convention:

FORMAT: F-[NN] where NN is a two-digit sequential number, zero-padded.

Examples: F-01, F-02, F-13, F-27

CONTINUITY RULES:

The finding index is continuous across the entire project lifecycle.
It never resets at phase boundaries or session boundaries — a new
finding always receives the next available number in the sequence.

Within a single Findings Report, findings are numbered sequentially
from whatever the project's current index requires. A report may
contain F-14 through F-22 if those are the next available numbers.

The cumulative index is tracked in two places:
- Each Findings Report records the range of finding IDs it contains
- The Session Log notes any findings generated during the session

If a project's finding count exceeds 99, extend to three digits
(F-100, F-101). The format accommodates growth without requiring
reindexing.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INDEXES:

The framework uses three parallel indexing systems:
- D-### for Decisions (project-wide, never resets)
- F-## for Findings (project-wide, never resets)
- [####] for Response Indexes (project-wide, never resets)

These indexes are independent — their sequences do not interact. A
session might produce F-14, D-035-002, and responses [0087] through
[0094], with each index tracking its own sequence.


5.6.5 Structured Finding Entry
--------------------------------

Each finding follows a five-field schema designed to separate
observation from interpretation:

FINDING ID: The unique F-## identifier.

DISCOVERY: A concise statement of the observation or insight. This
should be specific enough to stand alone — a reader should understand
the finding without additional context. One to three sentences.

EVIDENCE: The specific data points, test results, source references,
or observations that support the discovery. This is the empirical
foundation — what was seen, measured, or tested that led to the
discovery statement. Reference specific sessions, response indexes,
or external sources as appropriate.

IMPACT / IMPLICATION: Analysis of how this finding affects the project
— its pipeline, methodology, deliverables, or thesis. This field
connects the observation to the project's trajectory. What changes (or
should change) because of this discovery?

STATUS / VERDICT: The conclusion regarding the finding. Standard
verdicts include:

- VALIDATED — The finding confirms an approach, tool, or hypothesis
- GAP IDENTIFIED — The finding reveals a missing capability or content
- REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING — The finding is promising but inconclusive
- CONTRADICTS — The finding contradicts a prior assumption or approach
- INFORMS DECISION — The finding provides evidence for a pending choice
- NOTED — The finding is recorded for reference without immediate action

Custom verdicts are acceptable when standard options do not fit.

EXAMPLE ENTRY:

  F-14
  Discovery: Exhaustive querying technique achieves near-perfect
  context recovery between sessions when applied systematically
  (query → summarize → gap questions → repeat until saturation).

  Evidence: Tested across 3 sessions with varying context loads.
  Session 012 recovered 95%+ of prior session context through 4
  query rounds. Session 015 achieved full recovery in 3 rounds with
  a smaller corpus. Gap questions after initial summary consistently
  surfaced 2-4 additional details per round.

  Impact: Establishes exhaustive querying as the preferred context
  recovery method for sessions requiring deep prior-session awareness.
  Reduces dependency on comprehensive bootstraps for context-heavy
  sessions.

  Status: VALIDATED — Recommend codifying in manual Section 10.3.


5.6.6 When to Generate Findings Reports
-----------------------------------------

Not every session produces findings. Findings Reports are appropriate
when a session involves:

RESEARCH OR EXPLORATION: Sessions dedicated to investigating tools,
approaches, datasets, or methods. These sessions produce empirical
observations that warrant structured capture.

EVALUATION OR TESTING: Sessions where hypotheses are tested against
reality — stress tests, validation runs, comparative assessments.
The results are findings regardless of whether they confirm or
contradict expectations.

FIELD TESTING OR BETA TESTING: Sessions that apply a methodology or
tool in practice and observe its real-world behavior. The gap between
design intent and field reality is the primary source of findings.

SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTAL DISCOVERY: Even in execution sessions, an
unexpected observation may warrant a finding entry. In this case, the
finding can be captured as a brief entry in the Session Log (with an
F-## identifier) rather than requiring a standalone Findings Report.
The finding is then incorporated into the next full Findings Report
or the cumulative findings index.

Sessions that are purely execution-focused (drafting, formatting,
assembly) or purely administrative (file organization, project setup)
typically do not generate findings.

AI BEHAVIORAL GUIDANCE:

The AI should recognize research and exploration contexts and propose
Findings Report generation when the session produces empirical
observations. The proposal should occur during the session — not only
at closeout — so that findings are captured with full context rather
than reconstructed from memory.

When the AI observes a pattern of empirical discovery during a session,
it should ask: "This session is producing findings that warrant
structured capture. Shall I begin a Findings Report?"

The user may approve, defer to closeout, or decline. If approved, the
AI maintains the findings structure throughout the session, adding
entries as discoveries emerge.


5.6.7 Cumulative Findings Index
---------------------------------

For projects that generate multiple Findings Reports across many
sessions, maintaining a cumulative findings index provides a master
directory of all discoveries.

The cumulative index is a simple table:

| Finding ID | Discovery (brief) | Session | Status |
|------------|--------------------|---------|--------|

This index can be maintained as:
- A standalone reference document updated periodically
- A section within the Findings Report template (see TPL-0XX)
- A section within the Project Roadmap (TPL-010) for projects where
  findings drive the project trajectory

The index is particularly valuable for notebook queryability — a single
document containing all finding IDs and brief descriptions enables
targeted retrieval across the full findings corpus.


5.6.8 File Structure
---------------------

Findings Reports are maintained as individual files per session or
per research cycle:

File naming: [###]_findings.txt or [###]_findings_[topic].txt
Examples:
- 012_findings.txt
- 032_findings_beta-test-review.txt

For projects with extensive findings, a cumulative findings index may
be maintained as a separate file:
- [PROJECT]_cumulative-findings-index.txt

Individual files per reporting session are recommended because:
- Each file can be uploaded to notebooks independently
- Individual files are easier to reference from Session Logs
- Topical organization within each report keeps related findings together
- The cumulative index provides cross-report navigation


5.6.9 Template Reference
--------------------------

Template TPL-0XX (Findings Report) provides the standard structure
including header, findings entries, cumulative index, and provenance
tracking. See Appendix A.

Cross-reference: Section 5.3 (Decision Logs) for the complementary
choice record. Section 5.4 (Session Logs) for the complementary
activity record. Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity) for queryability
optimization. Section 5.8 (Artifact Relationships) for the Findings
Report's place in the artifact ecosystem.
