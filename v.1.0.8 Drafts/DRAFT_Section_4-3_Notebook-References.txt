DRAFT — SECTION 4.3 SESSION LIFECYCLE (NOTEBOOK REFERENCES)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 4.3 (ADDITIONS to Session B revised content)
Drafted:         Session 035
Category:        4 (NotebookLM / Notebook Integration) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE: These are lightweight additions to the Session B Section 4.3
revision (DRAFT_Section_4-3_Session-Lifecycle-Revised.txt). Session B
already includes:
- "Upload the transcript and non-ephemeral artifacts to the project
  notebook (if using notebook connectivity)" in USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES
- "Materials — what documents, files, and notebook access are confirmed"
  in the alignment turn checklist

These additions strengthen the notebook references without duplicating
what Session B already established.

BEGIN DRAFT CONTENT
================================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 1: Section 4.3.1 Session Initiation — ADD to "For Continuation
(Via Bootstrap)" sequence, after step 2 (AI executes Bootstrap mandatory
first action)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT as new step (between current steps 2 and 3):

   [New step]: If the Bootstrap specifies notebook connectivity
   references, the AI confirms accessibility and notes available
   notebooks. If pre-session notebook queries are indicated (e.g.,
   "Will need notebook queries before drafting"), the AI plans query
   strategy as part of alignment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 2: Section 4.3.2 Active Session Management — ADD to the
existing content or after Headroom Opportunism
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT (as a brief paragraph within active session management guidance):

NOTEBOOK QUERIES DURING ACTIVE WORK:

When the AI queries a notebook connectivity tool during the session, the
Connector Transparency Protocol (Section 4.4) applies. All queries must
be narrated in the conversation with tool identification, query details,
and result summary. This ensures the session transcript captures the
full informational content of the session, supporting both immediate
auditability and future context recovery through the notebook.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 3: Section 4.3.3 Session Closeout — ENHANCE existing user
duties list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Session B draft already includes this bullet in USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES:

  "- Upload the transcript and non-ephemeral artifacts to the project
    notebook (if using notebook connectivity)"

ADD a clarifying note after this bullet:

   See Section 10.3.3 for the detailed upload workflow, including
   guidance on what to upload versus skip. Notebook maintenance is a
   lightweight post-session task (typically 5-10 minutes) but is
   essential for maintaining the deep context recovery capability.
   A notebook that falls behind the project provides degraded retrieval.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
These additions layer onto the Session B Section 4.3 revision. They
should be applied after Session B's content is integrated.

- Addition 1: Insert into the continuation session initiation sequence
  in 4.3.1
- Addition 2: Insert into 4.3.2 (Active Session Management) or as a
  brief subsection alongside Headroom Opportunism and Segmentation
- Addition 3: Append to the existing notebook upload bullet in 4.3.3

CROSS-REFERENCES:
- Addition 1 references TPL-002 (Bootstrap) Notebook Connectivity block
- Addition 2 references Section 4.4 (Connector Transparency Protocol)
- Addition 3 references Section 10.3.3 (Upload Workflow)

These are intentionally lightweight — the substantive content lives in
Sections 10.3 and 4.4. These additions ensure Section 4.3 acknowledges
notebook connectivity at the appropriate lifecycle touchpoints without
duplicating the detailed guidance.
