1.4.6.1 — REPLACE EXISTING CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4.6.1 Starting Your First Project (Rooting)
----------------------------------------------

When you initiate a new project with AI assistance, you enter rooting —
the formal Phase 0 of every project. Rooting establishes the project's
foundation before any execution work begins. No prior state exists to
carry forward; everything must be explicitly built.

What to Upload:
- This manual (or relevant sections for your project type)
- Any existing materials relevant to the project (research, notes,
  prior work, reference documents)
- Completed Project Initiation Form (TPL-001), or be prepared to
  develop one through collaborative dialog with the AI

What the AI Does:
- Recognizes the AIPM framework and adopts its operational behaviors
- Reviews your TPL-001 or engages in structured collaborative dialog
  to develop one
- Probes assumptions, surfaces gaps, and proposes alternatives
- Helps structure the project into phases with clear objectives and
  exit criteria
- Drafts an initial Project Guide based on collaborative inputs
- Drafts a Base Phase Protocol (Layer 1 AIPM behaviors + Layer 2
  methodology + Layer 3 project context)
- Confirms alignment on both documents before concluding rooting

What You Do:
- Engage substantively in the collaborative rooting dialog — this is
  design work, not form completion
- Review the AI's Project Guide draft and correct any misinterpretations
- Review the Base Phase Protocol and verify behavioral expectations
- Approve both documents before rooting concludes
- Store the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge

Expected Outcome:
An established project with a Project Guide defining scope, objectives,
constraints, and phase structure, plus a Base Phase Protocol defining
how the AI should behave during the first execution phase. Both you and
the AI share a verified understanding of what you're building, how
you'll proceed, and what behavioral standards govern the work.

USER ACTION: After rooting concludes, store the Phase Protocol in
Project Knowledge. Verify the Bootstrap for the first execution session
includes a mandatory first action to review the Phase Protocol.

Common Pitfall: Rushing rooting to begin "real work." Rooting IS real
work — it builds the governance infrastructure that makes coherent
multi-session execution possible. If rooting takes multiple sessions,
that investment pays dividends throughout the project.

Cross-reference: Section 2.5.1 details the full rooting process.
Section 5.2 details the Phase Protocol.

1.4.6.2 — TARGETED ADDITIONS TO EXISTING CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD after "What to Upload" section (after line referencing bootstrap):

- Phase Protocol is already stored in Project Knowledge (no upload
  needed — the AI will review it as part of Bootstrap instructions)

ADD to "What the AI Does" section (insert as first item):

- Reviews the Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge as its mandatory
  first action, confirming adherence to all behavioral requirements

ADD to "Key Principle" paragraph (append):

Additionally, the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge provides
phase-stable behavioral governance that the AI reviews at every session
start. The Bootstrap instructs the AI to read the Phase Protocol; the
Phase Protocol tells the AI how to behave. Together, they ensure each
session begins with both current state awareness and behavioral
consistency.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4.6.4 — TARGETED ADDITIONS TO EXISTING CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to "What the AI Does" section (insert after "Updates the Roadmap"):

- Evaluates the current Phase Protocol against upcoming phase
  requirements; recommends redraft if behaviors need to change
- If redrafting, produces a new Phase Protocol for the upcoming phase
  incorporating lessons from the completed phase

ADD to "What You Do" section (insert after "Review the AI-generated
phase plan"):

- Review the Phase Protocol evaluation — approve carry-forward or
  redraft as appropriate
- If redrafted, store the new Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge and
  archive the prior version

ADD a new entry to the "Common Pitfall" section:

Common Pitfall: Carrying the Phase Protocol forward without review at
phase transitions. Even if no changes are needed, explicit evaluation
ensures behavioral governance remains intentional.
