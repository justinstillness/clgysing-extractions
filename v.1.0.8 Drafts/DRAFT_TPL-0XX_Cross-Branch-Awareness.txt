TPL-0XX: CROSS-BRANCH AWARENESS DOCUMENT

Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Provides a shared reference for projects with multiple active
         branches. Ensures every session — mainline or branch — has
         awareness of parallel workstreams without requiring full
         context on each branch.
When to Use: When a project has two or more active branches. Create
             when the second branch is established; update at natural
             checkpoints throughout the project.
Where to Store: Project Knowledge (alongside Phase Protocol), so that
                every session has access without explicit upload.

Cross-reference: Section 12.3.7 (Cross-Branch Awareness Document),
Section 12.3 (Branch Management)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document is a living reference maintained throughout a project's
branching lifecycle. It is stored in Project Knowledge so that every
AI instance — mainline or branch — can access it as part of the
mandatory first action.

UPDATE TRIGGERS:
- A new branch is created
- A branch completes, pauses, or is abandoned
- Inter-branch dependencies change
- An integration session occurs
- Significant scope changes in any branch
- Periodically during long-running parallel work (weekly recommended)

WRITING PRINCIPLES:
- Keep entries concise — this is an awareness tool, not a comprehensive
  record. 2-3 sentences per branch objective is sufficient.
- Focus on what other sessions need to know, not branch-internal details
- Flag coordination needs prominently — these are the items most likely
  to cause problems if missed

FILE NAMING:
[PROJECT]_cross-branch-awareness.txt
Example: GOV-AIPM_cross-branch-awareness.txt

This is a single file per project, updated in place (not versioned per
session like bootstraps or session logs).

BRANCH OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

[HANDLE]: [Branch Name]
--------------------------------------------------
Objective: [2-3 sentences: what this branch is working on and what it
will produce.]
Expected Deliverables: [List of key outputs]
Estimated Timeline: [Sessions remaining or target completion]
Notebook: [Branch adjunct notebook name and ID]

[HANDLE]: [Branch Name]
--------------------------------------------------
Objective: [...]
Expected Deliverables: [...]
Estimated Timeline: [...]
Notebook: [...]

[Repeat for each active branch]

================================================================================
INTER-BRANCH DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

[List any dependencies between branches or between branches and the
mainline. If no dependencies exist, state "No active inter-branch
dependencies."]

| Dependency                     | From          | To            | Status   |

Notes:
[Any additional context about dependencies — timing constraints,
workarounds, escalation needs.]

================================================================================
COORDINATION NEEDS
================================================================================

[Specific items requiring cross-branch attention. These are action items
or awareness items that could cause problems if missed.]

- [Coordination item — e.g., "SECRES evaluating encryption approach —
  TOOLINT should not commit to TLS implementation until SECRES
  concludes."]
- [Coordination item]
- [If none: "No active coordination needs."]

================================================================================
RECENT UPDATES
================================================================================

[Brief log of significant branch events since the last update. Most
recent first.]

[Date — Session ###]: [Event description — e.g., "SECRES branch
completed Phase 1. Findings F-14 through F-19 uploaded to main
notebook. Integration session planned for Session 042."]

[Date — Session ###]: [Event description]

[Date — Session ###]: [Event description]

================================================================================
COMPLETED / ARCHIVED BRANCHES
================================================================================

[Branches that have completed their work and been integrated, or that
have been abandoned. Maintained for project history.]

TEMPLATE NOTES
================================================================================

DESIGN RATIONALE:

This template prioritizes scanability. A session AI should be able to
read the document in under 30 seconds and understand: how many branches
are active, what each is doing, and whether any coordination needs
affect its own work.

The document is deliberately lightweight. It does not duplicate branch
session logs, bootstraps, or findings — it provides awareness-level
context with pointers to detailed records. The branch adjunct notebook
IDs in each branch entry enable direct querying when deeper context is
needed.

STORAGE IN PROJECT KNOWLEDGE:

Storing this document in Project Knowledge (rather than requiring
explicit upload each session) means every session automatically has
access. The Phase Protocol's mandatory first action review naturally
pairs with awareness document review for projects with active branches.

The Bootstrap may include a reminder to check the awareness document,
particularly for branch sessions that have been paused and are resuming.

SINGLE FILE, UPDATED IN PLACE:

Unlike session-specific artifacts (logs, bootstraps), the Cross-Branch
Awareness Document is a single file updated in place. This ensures
there is always exactly one current version. Old versions are not
preserved separately — the "Recent Updates" log provides a change
history within the document itself.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TEMPLATES:

- TPL-0XX (Branch Startup File): When a Startup File is generated,
  the awareness document should be updated to register the new branch.
- TPL-002 (Bootstrap): Mainline bootstraps should note active branches
  and reference the awareness document.
- TPL-005 (Session Log): Integration sessions should log awareness
  document updates in the files produced section.
