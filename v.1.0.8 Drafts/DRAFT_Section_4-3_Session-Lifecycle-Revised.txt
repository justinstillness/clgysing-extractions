DRAFT SECTION — For integration into GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 4.3 (MAJOR REVISION — replaces existing 4.3.1
                 through 4.3.3; 4.3.4 and 4.3.5 unchanged except as noted)
Current Lines:   2356-2454 (Sections 4.3 through 4.3.3 and 4.3.4)
                 Section 4.3.5+ retained as-is (Session E scope)
Drafted:         Session 034
Category:        3 (Enhanced Session Lifecycle) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE ON SESSION A INTEGRATION:

This draft supersedes Integration Point 1 from Session A
(DRAFT_Integration-Points_Phase-Protocol.txt), which provided a stub
revision of 4.3.1. The Session A stub established the Phase Protocol
review and alignment turn concepts. This draft expands those into full
protocol specifications and adds the remaining Session B content
(response indexing, closeout revision, headroom opportunism,
segmentation enhancement).

Section 4.3.5 (Phase Transition Sessions) is NOT revised here — that is
Session E scope. Integration Point 2 from Session A (adding Phase
Protocol evaluation to 4.3.5) remains valid and should be applied
separately.

================================================================================


4.3 SESSION LIFECYCLE
---------------------

Each chat session follows a lifecycle from initiation through closeout.
Managing this lifecycle ensures continuity, prevents work loss, and
maintains the behavioral consistency that makes multi-session projects
coherent.

The session lifecycle has three phases: initiation (establishing context
and alignment), active work (producing deliverables within scope), and
closeout (preserving work and enabling clean resumption). Each phase has
specific protocols that have been refined through extensive field testing.

Two cross-cutting practices span the entire session lifecycle: the
Response Indexing System, which maintains a persistent retrieval index
across all sessions, and Headroom Opportunism, which optimizes the use
of remaining context capacity after primary objectives are met.


4.3.1 Session Initiation
-------------------------

Proper session start establishes productive trajectory. The initiation
sequence varies by session type but always includes behavioral alignment
through the Phase Protocol and explicit scope verification through the
Alignment Turn.

SESSION INITIATION SEQUENCE — BY TYPE:

For New Projects (Rooting / Phase 0):

1. Upload this manual (or orient the AI to the AIPM framework)
2. Describe project objectives and desired outcomes
3. Engage in the collaborative rooting process (see Section 2.5.1)
4. Produce Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol
5. Generate Bootstrap for the first execution session

Rooting sessions do not follow the standard continuation sequence below
because no prior state exists. The rooting process itself establishes
the governance infrastructure that subsequent sessions rely on.

Cross-reference: Section 2.5.1 details the full rooting process.
Section 1.4.6.1 provides the user workflow overview.

For Continuation (Via Bootstrap):

1. User provides Bootstrap file and any required attachments
2. AI executes the Bootstrap's mandatory first action — typically:
   review the Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge and confirm
   adherence to all behavioral requirements
3. AI acknowledges the Bootstrap and confirms understanding of current
   state, including response index continuity (see Section 4.3.1.2)
4. AI generates the Alignment Checklist (see Section 4.3.1.1)
5. User verifies the Alignment Checklist
6. If aligned, work proceeds; if misaligned, adjustments are made
   before proceeding
7. AI requests and verifies any dependencies noted in the Bootstrap

This sequence is mandatory, not optional. Skipping steps — particularly
the alignment turn — leads to the failure modes documented below.

For Branch Sessions:

1. User provides Branch Startup File (see Section [Branch Management])
2. AI reviews the inherited Phase Protocol (which may be modified for
   the branch's specific scope)
3. If this is the branch's first session, conduct a mini-rooting cycle
   to establish branch-specific context
4. AI generates an Alignment Checklist specific to branch scope
5. User verifies alignment
6. Establish integration expectations with the mainline project

Cross-reference: Section 5.2 details the Phase Protocol. Section 5.5
details Bootstrap Files.


4.3.1.1 The Alignment Turn
--------------------------

The Alignment Turn is a mandatory exchange at the start of every
continuation session. After the AI has reviewed the Phase Protocol and
acknowledged the Bootstrap, it generates an Alignment Checklist and
presents it to the user for verification before any substantive work
begins.

PURPOSE:

The Alignment Turn prevents three failure modes:

Evaporation — starting work without shared understanding of objectives.
The AI may interpret the Bootstrap differently than the user intended,
or the user's priorities may have shifted since the Bootstrap was
written. The Alignment Turn surfaces these disconnects before they
compound.

Missing Context — beginning without required materials loaded. The
Bootstrap may reference files, notebooks, or prior artifacts that need
to be present before work can proceed. The Alignment Turn verifies that
all dependencies are satisfied.

Misalignment — working toward different objectives than intended. In
complex projects with multiple active threads, the session's focus may
need adjustment based on developments since the Bootstrap was written.
The Alignment Turn creates space for this recalibration.

ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST STRUCTURE:

The AI generates the Alignment Checklist covering:

Scope — what this session aims to accomplish, stated as specific
objectives drawn from the Bootstrap and any user input at session start.

Materials — what documents, files, and notebook access are confirmed
present, and what is still needed.

Workflow — the proposed sequence of work for the session, including
natural breakpoints and priority ordering.

Expected Outputs — the deliverables and artifacts the session should
produce.

Gaps or Questions — anything unclear, potentially conflicting, or
requiring user clarification before work begins.

PROTOCOL:

1. The AI generates the checklist and presents it to the user
2. The user reviews and responds:
   - "Aligned" (or equivalent confirmation) — work proceeds
   - Corrections or adjustments — the AI incorporates changes and
     re-presents if needed
   - Additional context — the user provides information that reshapes
     the session plan
3. Work begins only after explicit user confirmation

The Alignment Checklist Template (TPL-0XX) provides the standard format.
The AI may adapt the depth and detail of the checklist to match session
complexity — a simple continuation session warrants a concise checklist,
while a complex multi-deliverable session warrants a thorough one.

AI COORDINATOR NOTE: The Alignment Turn is part of the Session
Stewardship Duty (see Section 2.7). Generate the alignment checklist
proactively at session start. Do not begin substantive work before user
confirmation, even if the session scope seems obvious from the Bootstrap.


4.3.1.2 Response Indexing System
--------------------------------

The Response Indexing System provides a persistent, project-wide
numbering scheme for significant AI responses. Every substantive AI
output receives a sequential index that enables precise retrieval from
transcripts across the project's entire history.

FORMAT:

[####] | Semantic Title

Where:
- [####] is a four-digit, zero-padded sequential number (e.g., [0001],
  [0042], [0157])
- The semantic title is a brief description of the response's primary
  content or action (e.g., "Session 034 Initiation & Protocol
  Confirmation," "Headroom Assessment & Segmentation Plan,"
  "Closeout Artifacts — Session Log & Bootstrap")

The index appears at the start of every substantive AI response.

CONTINUITY RULES:

The response index is continuous across the entire project lifecycle.
It never resets at phase boundaries or session boundaries — only at the
project level (a new project starts a new sequence at [0001]).

Session Continuity: The Bootstrap specifies two fields for response
index continuity:
- "Last response index: [####]" — where the prior session ended
- "NEXT SESSION STARTS AT INDEX: [####]" — where this session begins

The AI inherits the index from the Bootstrap and continues the sequence
without gaps.

Recovery Protocol: If the Bootstrap lacks response index information, or
if the sequence appears broken (e.g., an unexpected gap or duplicate),
the AI asks the user for recovery guidance rather than guessing. The
user may direct the AI to continue from a specified number, restart from
[0001], or check the prior session log for the correct index.

WHAT GETS INDEXED:

All substantive AI responses receive an index. This includes:
- Session initiation acknowledgments
- Alignment checklists
- Research and analysis outputs
- Drafted content and deliverables
- Headroom assessments
- Closeout artifacts (session logs, bootstraps)
- Any response that advances the session's work

Brief clarifying exchanges, simple confirmations, and error corrections
may omit the index at the AI's discretion, though when in doubt, index.

PURPOSE:

The Response Indexing System enables precise retrieval from transcripts.
The Session Log records all indexes used during the session (in the
Response Index Register), creating a structured lookup table: the log
tells you which response index to look for, and the transcript contains
the full content at that index. This is significantly faster than
searching unindexed transcripts for specific content.

The system also provides a project-level activity metric — the highest
response index indicates the total volume of substantive AI work across
all sessions.

SESSION LOG INTEGRATION:

Each Session Log includes a Response Index Register recording all indexes
used in the session, the semantic title for each, and the session's index
range. See Section 5.4 for the Session Log entry structure and TPL-005
for the template.

BOOTSTRAP INTEGRATION:

Every Bootstrap includes response index continuity fields in its Dynamic
State section. See Section 5.5 for Bootstrap structure and TPL-002 for
the template.


4.3.2 Active Session Management
--------------------------------

During productive work:

Maintain Focus:
- Stay within the scope confirmed during the alignment turn
- Defer out-of-scope items to the Backlog Register or appropriate
  future sessions
- Note but do not pursue tangents — capture them for later consideration

Monitor Tokens:
- Be aware of session length and context consumption
- Notice if responses become truncated or less coherent (see Section
  4.2.4 for warning signs)
- Plan exit before limits force it
- The AI should proactively assess headroom before major work blocks,
  not only at session boundaries

Checkpoint Progress:
- Confirm understanding at transition points between work blocks
- Request file outputs for completed work — do not let substantial
  work exist only in conversation
- If producing multiple deliverables, save each as a discrete file
  before moving to the next

Document Decisions:
- Note significant decisions as they occur, including rationale
- Capture the reasoning, not just the conclusion — future sessions will
  need to understand why, not just what
- These feed the Decision Log; if criteria are met per TPL-002, a
  dedicated Decision Log file is generated at closeout


4.3.2.1 Headroom Opportunism
-----------------------------

Headroom Opportunism is the strategic practice of utilizing remaining
token capacity after primary objectives are met but before the session
must close. It is a named duty of the AI coordinator — not optional
optimization but a deliberate part of session management.

When primary session objectives are complete, the AI assesses remaining
headroom and identifies secondary objectives that can be achieved with
the loaded context. The AI then proposes specific options to the user,
who decides whether to proceed.

This practice optimizes the value of context already loaded into the
session. Context loading is expensive — files uploaded, notebook queries
executed, state established. When primary work completes with headroom
remaining, that loaded context represents unrealized value. Headroom
Opportunism captures that value without scope creep because the user
retains full control over whether to proceed.

PROTOCOL:

1. Primary objectives are complete
2. AI estimates remaining headroom and the token cost of mandatory
   closeout artifacts (session log, bootstrap, any other required
   outputs)
3. AI identifies secondary objectives from:
   - The Bootstrap's secondary/tertiary objectives
   - Items in the Backlog Register that are achievable with loaded
     context
   - Quality audit items identified during the session
   - Research queries or exploratory work that leverages current context
4. AI proposes specific options to the user with estimated token cost
   for each
5. User selects, modifies, or declines
6. If proceeding, the AI executes the selected work and reassesses
   headroom before closeout

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:

Headroom Opportunism never compromises closeout quality. The mandatory
closeout artifacts — Session Log with embedded SFR, Bootstrap, and
conditional Decision Log — require sufficient headroom for thorough
generation. If remaining capacity after primary work is marginal, the
AI should recommend proceeding directly to closeout rather than risking
compressed or degraded closing artifacts.

The headroom floor — the minimum capacity reserved for closeout — should
be assessed before proposing secondary work. If the floor cannot
accommodate both the proposed secondary work and full closeout, the
secondary work is deferred.

Cross-reference: Section 4.2.2 (Headroom Discipline).

DISTINCTION FROM SCOPE CREEP:

Headroom Opportunism is not scope creep. Scope creep is uncontrolled
expansion of session objectives. Headroom Opportunism is controlled
utilization of excess capacity with explicit user approval. The
distinction lies in intentionality and consent:
- Scope creep happens without deliberate decision
- Headroom Opportunism is proposed, evaluated, and approved


4.3.3 Session Closeout
-----------------------

Proper closeout preserves work and enables clean resumption. The closeout
protocol has a specific trigger, a defined sequence, and mandatory
artifacts.

TRIGGER:

"CLOSE OUT" (or equivalent phrasing) is the only keyword trigger for
closeout. The AI never auto-initiates closeout. This is a firm boundary:
the user controls when a session ends.

User language interpretation:
- "we can wrap up soon" → the AI asks: "Ready to close out?"
- "do X then close out" → the AI completes X, then asks: "Ready to
  close out?"
- "close out" → the AI initiates the closeout sequence

The rationale for user-only initiation: field testing revealed that
AI-initiated closeout suggestions disrupt flow and create pressure to
end prematurely. The user is the best judge of when work should conclude.
The AI's role is to ensure the closeout is thorough once initiated, not
to decide when it occurs.

EXCEPTION: If the AI detects clear signs of context exhaustion (see
Section 4.2.4), it should alert the user to the degradation and
recommend closeout — but still wait for user confirmation before
initiating the sequence.

CLOSEOUT SEQUENCE:

The closeout follows a five-step protocol:

Step 1 — Loose Ends Assessment. The AI pauses and systematically
assesses outstanding items across six categories:

- Decisions: Were any decisions made that need formal documentation?
  Are there unresolved decision points?
- Scope Items: Was everything planned for this session completed? What
  was deferred? Are any planned items at risk of being lost?
- Questions: Are there unanswered questions that could affect future
  sessions?
- Artifacts: Are all produced files accounted for? Has anything been
  discussed but not saved as a file?
- Handoff Context: What must be explicitly captured in the Bootstrap for
  the next session to proceed without loss?
- User Action Items: What does the user need to do after the session
  ends? (exports, uploads, file organization, external actions)

Step 2 — Present Loose Ends. The AI presents the loose ends assessment
to the user in a clear, structured format. This is a verification
moment — the user may identify items the AI missed or deprioritize items
the AI flagged.

Step 3 — Resolve Loose Ends. Per user direction, address any items that
need resolution before closeout. This may include:
- Capturing a decision that was made informally during the session
- Saving a draft that exists only in conversation
- Noting a deferred item for the Bootstrap
- Answering a question that will affect the next session

Step 4 — Confirm Readiness. The AI lists the artifacts it will generate
and confirms with the user before proceeding:
- Session Log (with embedded Session Fidelity Report) — ALWAYS
- Bootstrap (for the next session) — ALWAYS
- Decision Log — CONDITIONAL (if decision log trigger criteria from
  TPL-002 are met)
- Any other session-specific deliverables not yet produced

Step 5 — Generate Artifacts. Only after user confirmation, the AI
generates all closeout artifacts. These are produced as discrete files
for download, not embedded in conversation.

MANDATORY CLOSEOUT ARTIFACTS:

Session Log (with embedded SFR): Records what occurred, indexes used,
decisions made, files produced, and provides the fidelity assessment.
Always generated. See Section 5.4 and TPL-005.

Bootstrap: Enables clean resumption in the next session. Contains all
context needed for the next AI instance to continue without loss. Always
generated. See Section 5.5 and TPL-002.

Decision Log: Formal record of decisions with rationale, alternatives
considered, and implications. Generated when trigger criteria are met
(see TPL-002 for trigger criteria). Minor decisions captured within the
Session Log do not require a separate Decision Log.

USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES:

After the AI generates closeout artifacts, the user completes their
own closeout actions:
- Export the chat transcript (via Claude Exporter or equivalent)
- Download all AI-produced files
- Organize files per the project's folder convention
- Upload the transcript and non-ephemeral artifacts to the project
  notebook (if using notebook connectivity)
- Update personal task tracking as needed

The Session Closeout Checklist (TPL-003) provides the complete protocol
including both AI and user responsibilities.

Cross-reference: Section 4.3.4 (Emergency Exit) covers the abbreviated
protocol for unexpected token exhaustion.


4.3.2.2 Large Artifact Segmentation Protocol
---------------------------------------------

When a session requires producing large artifacts — lengthy documents,
extensive analysis, multi-part deliverables — the segmentation protocol
prevents token exhaustion mid-draft and maintains output quality
throughout.

TRIGGERS FOR SEGMENTATION:

Segmentation should be proactively planned when any of the following
conditions apply:
- Source material exceeds 5,000 words
- Expected output exceeds 20 discrete entries (concepts, items, records)
- Estimated output exceeds 10,000 characters
- Token headroom is below 20% of estimated session capacity
- A repository or collection approaches 75 entries (volume cap)

The AI should assess these triggers before beginning any substantial
generation task. Proactive segmentation planning is always preferable
to reactive recovery after a token cliff.

METHODOLOGY:

1. Logical Unit Division. Identify natural division points in the work:
   sections, chapters, conceptual clusters, source boundaries, or other
   structural breaks. The goal is segments that are meaningful units of
   work, not arbitrary slices.

2. Conservative Chunk Sizing. Target approximately 10,000 characters per
   segment as a working guideline. This leaves margin for cross-segment
   continuity content (numbering, cross-references, transition notes)
   without pressing against headroom limits.

3. Cross-Segment Continuity. Maintain sequential numbering, consistent
   formatting, and explicit cross-references across segments. Each
   segment should begin with a brief orientation noting what came before
   and what comes next. The final segment should include a completeness
   verification.

4. User Approval at Each Stage. Present each completed segment to the
   user before proceeding to the next. This creates natural checkpoints
   for quality review and course correction.

5. Completion Verification. After all segments are produced, verify
   completeness: are all items accounted for? Does the combined output
   meet the original scope? Are cross-segment references consistent?

CRITICAL RULE: Never abbreviate, truncate, or compress artifacts to
avoid segmentation. Segmentation maintains complete, full-quality
generation while managing constraints. The quality standard is the same
whether output is produced in one pass or five segments. If the AI finds
itself reducing detail or omitting content to fit within a single
response, it should stop and segment instead.

This rule exists because field testing revealed a persistent failure
mode: AIs will silently compress output quality to avoid the overhead
of segmentation, producing technically complete but substantively
degraded artifacts. Explicit segmentation prevents this.

(Token Exhaustion Recovery Protocol).

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
- This content replaces existing Sections 4.3 through 4.3.3 (lines
  2356-2430 approximately in v1.0.7)
- Section 4.3.4 (Emergency Exit) is RETAINED as-is (lines 2432-2454)
- Section 4.3.5 (Phase Transition Sessions) is RETAINED as-is — Session
  E will revise it separately; Session A's Integration Point 2 (Phase
  Protocol evaluation addition) should be applied independently

STRUCTURAL CHANGES:
- 4.3.1 expanded with two new subsections:
  - 4.3.1.1 The Alignment Turn (new)
  - 4.3.1.2 Response Indexing System (new)
- 4.3.2 Active Session Management lightly revised
  - 4.3.2.1 Headroom Opportunism (new subsection)
  - 4.3.2.2 Large Artifact Segmentation Protocol (new subsection —
    content enhanced from what was previously implicit in Section 4.2
    and 4.3.5.2.1; consider whether to retain the segmentation guidance
    in 4.3.5.2.1 or cross-reference to this section)
- 4.3.3 Session Closeout substantially revised (new 5-step protocol)

CROSS-REFERENCES TO UPDATE IN SESSION G:
- Section 2.7 (AI Duties) should reference Headroom Opportunism and
  the Alignment Turn as named duties
- Section 5.4 (Session Logs, new numbering) should reference the
  Response Index Register requirement
- Section 5.5 (Bootstrap Files, new numbering) should reference
  response index continuity fields
- Section 12.1 (Multi-Session Continuity) should reference response
  indexing as a retrieval enabler and the SFR as a continuity
  verification tool
- Glossary (Section 17.2) needs entries for: Response Index, Alignment
  Turn, Headroom Opportunism, Session Fidelity Report, Loose Ends
  Assessment

CONSISTENCY WITH SESSION A DRAFTS:
- Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol) references response indexing, alignment
  turns, and the closeout protocol — this draft provides the full
  specifications those references point to
- Integration Point 1 (revised 4.3.1) from Session A is superseded by
  this draft, which expands the stub into complete protocol documentation
- Phase Protocol Template (Layer 1, Part A) includes behavioral specs
  for session management — this draft's manual content is consistent
  with those template specifications

QUALITY AUDIT NOTES:
- Section 4.3.2 (Active Session Management) was lightly revised for
  consistency but found to be adequate in the current version. The
  addition of Headroom Opportunism and Segmentation Protocol as named
  subsections addresses the identified gaps without requiring a full
  rewrite of the parent section.
- Section 4.3.4 (Emergency Exit) reviewed and found adequate — no
  changes needed. The existing protocol aligns with field-tested
  practice.
- The segmentation protocol (4.3.2.2) consolidates guidance that was
  previously split between Section 4.2 (token management) and Section
  4.3.5.2.1 (phase transition token considerations). The Session G
  integration pass should evaluate whether to consolidate these or
  maintain cross-references.
