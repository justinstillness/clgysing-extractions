APPENDIX D:   Decisions Made This Session

================================================================================
CATEGORY 1: PHASE PROTOCOL
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual has no equivalent

CURRENT STATE IN v1.0.7:
Manual discusses Project Guides and Bootstraps as primary continuity
documents. No concept of a phase-stable governance document between them.

FIELD FINDING:
The Phase Protocol emerged as the most critical single improvement to the
AIPM system. It is a layered document that serves as the "constitution" for
a project phase.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- PHASE-STABLE: Static within a phase (unlike bootstraps, which change
  every session)
- LAYERED ARCHITECTURE:
  Layer 1: AIPM Framework Behaviors (universal across all projects)
  Layer 2: System/Methodology Context (project-type-specific)
  Layer 3: Project-Specific Context (unique to the project)
- MANDATORY REVIEW: Must be reviewed at start of every session as first action
- CREATED DURING ROOTING: Developed as Phase 0 output
- EVOLVES AT TRANSITIONS: Redrafted when phases change (8-step process)
- STORED IN PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: Persistent across sessions

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS:
- Project Guide: Comprehensive canonical reference (stable across project)
- Phase Protocol: Phase-specific governance (stable within a phase)
- Bootstrap: Session-specific state handoff (changes every session)

The Phase Protocol draws FROM the Project Guide to create phase-specific
behavioral guidance. It tells the AI HOW to behave. The Bootstrap tells
the AI WHERE we left off.

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Dedicated section introducing the Phase Protocol concept
2. Explanation of three-layer architecture
3. Relationship diagram: Project Guide → Phase Protocol → Bootstrap
4. Template for Phase Protocol creation
5. Guidance on when to create vs. when to skip (if behaviors don't change)
6. Phase Protocol redrafting triggers and process
7. Integration throughout manual wherever session initiation, phase
   transitions, and continuity are discussed
8. The "ceremony is continuity" philosophy that underpins it

VALIDATED BY:
- Same Phase Protocol successfully used across 4 branches (CLGYSING
  mainline, AWSNBLM, NLMINTA, and a fourth test branch)
- 23+ sessions on AWSNBLM branch alone with same base protocol
- External validation through notebook queries confirming effectiveness

================================================================================
CATEGORY 2: ROOTING AS PHASE 0
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual treats project initiation generically

CURRENT STATE IN v1.0.7:
Project initiation covered but not as a formalized, named phase with
specific objectives and exit criteria.

FIELD FINDING:
Rooting is ALWAYS Phase 0 of any project. Its purpose is to create the
Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol before execution begins.

ROOTING PROCESS:
1. User uploads AIPM manual to new project
2. User describes what they want to accomplish
3. AI uses AIPM framework to help organize the project
4. Together they determine:
   - Deliverables and objectives
   - Methodological approach
   - End result format (what form will output take?)
   - Phase structure (grouping objectives into discrete phases)
   - Templates needed (known now or anticipated for later)
   - Dependencies between phases
5. Output: Project Guide + Base Phase Protocol

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- "If rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions — this is the nervous
  system of your project"
- Knowing the end helps discern the means and process
- AI should help anticipate future needs (e.g., if end-result format
  unknown, note it for later resolution)
- Rooting is not just planning — it's building the governance infrastructure

SINE WAVE MODEL:
Project rhythm visualized as sine wave:
- Peaks = active phase work (high-output execution)
- Zero-crossings = phase transitions (planning, scoping, protocol work)
- Rooting is the first zero-crossing before the first peak

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Formalize rooting as Phase 0 with defined activities, outputs, exit criteria
2. Step-by-step rooting process guide
3. Sine wave model as mental model for project rhythm
4. Emphasis on not rushing rooting
5. Example: research project rooting walkthrough
6. Connection to Phase Protocol creation (rooting produces the first PP)

================================================================================
CATEGORY 3: ENHANCED SESSION LIFECYCLE
================================================================================
Type: REFINEMENT of existing manual content

SUB-FINDING 3.1: RESPONSE INDEXING SYSTEM

Format: **[####] | [Semantic Title]**
Rules:
- 4-digit sequential number (0001, 0002, 0003...)
- Continues across ENTIRE project (never resets at phase boundaries)
- Reset only at project level (new project = new sequence)
- Semantic title describes primary content/action
- Index appears at START of every response
- Session Log records all indexes used
- Bootstrap specifies: "Last response index: [####]"
- Bootstrap specifies: "NEXT SESSION STARTS AT INDEX: [####]"

Recovery Protocol: If bootstrap lacks index or sequence appears broken,
AI asks user for recovery guidance.

PURPOSE: Enables precise retrieval from transcripts. Session Log tells you
which response index to look for; transcript has the content.

SUB-FINDING 3.2: ALIGNMENT TURN AT SESSION START

Mandatory sequence AFTER protocol review and bootstrap acknowledgment:
1. Generate alignment checklist (scope, materials, workflow, outputs, gaps)
2. Present to user for verification
3. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
4. If misaligned, propose adjustments
5. Request and verify dependencies

Prevents three failure modes:
- Evaporation (starting without shared understanding)
- Missing context (beginning without required materials)
- Misalignment (working toward different objectives)

SUB-FINDING 3.3: CLOSEOUT PROTOCOL REFINEMENT

"CLOSE OUT" is the ONLY keyword trigger. AI NEVER auto-initiates.

User language interpretation:
- "we can wrap up soon" → AI asks "Ready to close out?"
- "do X then close out" → AI does X, then asks "Ready to close out?"
- "close out" → AI initiates closeout sequence

Closeout sequence (5 steps):
1. Pause and assess loose ends (decisions, scope items, questions,
   artifacts, handoffs, user action items)
2. Present loose ends to user
3. Resolve loose ends per user direction
4. Confirm readiness — list artifacts to be generated
5. Generate artifacts ONLY after user confirmation

Mandatory closeout artifacts:
- Session Log (with embedded SFR) — ALWAYS
- Bootstrap (for next session) — ALWAYS
- Decision Log (if decisions made outside planned scope) — CONDITIONAL

SUB-FINDING 3.4: SESSION FIDELITY REPORT (SFR)

Embedded in Session Log (not separate artifact).
Generated at session closeout.

Structure:
- Objective Achievement: FULL / PARTIAL / MINIMAL
- Phase Progress: Completion criteria status with checkmarks
- Decisions Crystallized: Summary
- Gaps & Insights: What was identified
- Handoff Status: Context carried forward, materials needed, risks
- Next Session Projection: Focus, success criteria, complexity estimate
- Verification: User confirms accuracy

SUB-FINDING 3.5: HEADROOM OPPORTUNISM

Named duty for AI coordinator:
- When primary objectives complete, assess remaining token headroom
- Identify secondary objectives achievable with loaded context
- Propose to user with specific options
- User decides whether to proceed
- This is optimization of loaded context, NOT scope creep

SUB-FINDING 3.6: LARGE ARTIFACT SEGMENTATION PROTOCOL

Already partially in manual but needs enhancement.
Triggers:
- Source material >5,000 words
- Expected output >20 entries
- Estimated output >10,000 characters
- Token headroom <20%
- Repository volume cap at 75 entries

Methodology:
1. Logical unit division (by source sections, conceptual clusters, etc.)
2. Conservative chunk sizing (~10,000 chars per segment)
3. Cross-segment continuity (sequential numbering, cross-references)
4. User approval at each stage
5. Completion verification

CRITICAL RULE: Never abbreviate artifacts to avoid segmentation.
Segmentation maintains complete generation while managing constraints.

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Update session lifecycle sections with all sub-findings
2. Add response indexing as core practice
3. Update closeout protocol
4. Update or add templates for alignment checklist, session log with
   embedded SFR
5. Add headroom opportunism as named coordinator duty
6. Enhance segmentation protocol guidance

================================================================================
CATEGORY 4: NOTEBOOKLM / NOTEBOOK INTEGRATION
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual predates this capability

CURRENT STATE IN v1.0.7:
No mention of NotebookLM or external notebook/query system.

FIELD FINDING:
NotebookLM via MCP has become the deep context recovery layer, giving
Claude "near-perfect fidelity capacity between sessions."

RELATIONSHIP TO BOOTSTRAPS:
- Bootstrap = lightweight orientation tool (WHERE we left off)
- NotebookLM = deep context archive (EVERYTHING that happened)
- Bootstrap SUPPLEMENTS, does not replace
- Bootstrap tells AI what to look for; NotebookLM has the content

UPLOAD WORKFLOW (post-session):
1. Download transcript (via Claude Exporter or equivalent)
2. Download all session artifacts
3. Store in session folder locally
4. Upload transcript to project NotebookLM notebook
5. Upload non-ephemeral artifacts (specs, WIPs, findings — NOT bootstraps
   or session logs that are purely ephemeral)
6. Sync if using Google Docs as intermediary

EXHAUSTIVE QUERYING TECHNIQUE:
1. AI queries NotebookLM on a subject
2. AI summarizes what it received
3. AI asks gap question: "Is there anything else I'm missing?"
4. Repeat until saturation (responses start returning similar content)
5. AI then has comprehensive context without consuming full token budget

NOTEBOOK ORGANIZATION STRATEGY:
- GENERAL RULE: One notebook for the whole project (all branches access it)
- ADJUNCT NOTEBOOKS: Per-branch, external research, spec documentation,
  or other targeted purposes
- SOURCE EFFICIENCY: For limited plans, consolidate transcripts into one
  Google Doc with tabs per session, sync as single source
- QUERYABILITY: Good naming, finding reports, status reports, and
  consistent terminology create the queryable surface

NOTEBOOK INDEX/DIRECTORY:
A manifest document listing all notebook IDs, their contents/summaries,
and purposes. Gives Claude a single reference file for knowing where to
look without querying each notebook individually.

Create by: Query each notebook for summary, compile into single directory doc.

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. New section on notebook integration as continuity enhancement
2. Upload workflow with step-by-step guidance
3. Exhaustive querying technique description
4. Notebook organization strategy (one main + adjuncts)
5. Source efficiency techniques for limited plans
6. Notebook index/directory concept
7. Reference "notebook connectivity tool" generically (tool-agnostic)
   with concrete examples
8. Guidance on what to upload vs. skip

================================================================================
CATEGORY 5: FINDINGS REPORTS
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Not currently in the manual as a distinct artifact

CURRENT STATE IN v1.0.7:
No findings report template or concept. Session logs capture what happened;
decision logs capture choices. But empirical discoveries during research
or exploration have no dedicated artifact.

FIELD FINDING:
Findings Reports are synthesis documents organized by TOPIC (not
chronologically like session logs). They use F## indexing that accumulates
across the project and are highly queryable via NotebookLM.

STRUCTURED FINDING ENTRY:
- Finding ID: F## (sequential, never resets)
- Discovery: Concise statement of observation
- Evidence: Specific data points or test results
- Impact/Implication: How this affects project pipeline or methodology
- Status/Verdict: Validates tool, identifies gap, requires further testing

DISTINCTION FROM OTHER ARTIFACTS:
- Session Log (LOG): Chronological record of WHAT HAPPENED
- Decision Log (DECISION): Record of CHOICES MADE (D-###)
- Findings Report (FINDINGS): Synthesis of DISCOVERIES (F-##)
  Findings provide evidence → which informs Decisions

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Findings Report as new artifact class
2. Template with structured entry schema
3. Indexing convention (F## accumulating across project)
4. Behavioral guidance: when to generate (research/exploration sessions)
5. Cumulative findings index tracking across sessions

================================================================================
CATEGORY 6: BRANCH MANAGEMENT
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual has no branching concept

FIELD FINDING:
Branching is a formal mechanism for managing parallel workstreams under
one project. Branches inherit the parent Phase Protocol but adapt scope.

BRANCH CREATION PROCESS:
1. User decides to spin up a branch (in mainline or dedicated session)
2. Mainline session generates a BRANCH STARTUP FILE with relevant context
3. User takes startup file to new branch
4. New branch conducts MINI-ROOTING CYCLE:
   - What is this branch trying to accomplish?
   - How does it connect to mainline?
   - Do we need to update the Phase Protocol?
   - Single-phase or multi-phase?
   - What templates/conventions apply?
5. Branch begins execution with its own session numbering

BRANCH CHARACTERISTICS:
- Own session numbering
- Own NotebookLM notebook (adjunct to main project notebook)
- Own bootstraps and session logs
- Inherited Phase Protocol (potentially modified)
- Fractal expression of rooting principles at branch level

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Branching concept introduction
2. Branch startup file template
3. Mini-rooting process for branches
4. Branch naming conventions
5. Cross-branch context sharing patterns
6. When to branch vs. when to stay in mainline

================================================================================
CATEGORY 7: USER BEHAVIORS & USER GUIDE
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual is primarily AI-facing

THE 90/10 OBSERVATION:
Manual provides ~90% coverage for AI behavior. Missing ~10% is user-facing
guidance. Field testing revealed that even with perfect AI protocols,
user behaviors are critical for system effectiveness.

CRITICAL USER BEHAVIORS IDENTIFIED:

7.1 PROJECT HANDLE NAMING
- Short, consistent tag (3-10 characters)
- Used in all naming conventions: files, sessions, folders
- AI can help create during rooting
- Examples: GOV-AIPM, CLGYSING, AWSNBLM

7.2 NEW CHAT NOTEPAD SYSTEM
External notepad (Google Keep or equivalent) containing:
- Chat name field (copy-paste ready)
- Standard opening line ("Please review and let me know if you have
  any questions")
- NotebookLM references (notebook IDs and descriptions)
- Behavioral reminders (things Claude tends to forget)
- Any between-session notes or context updates

PURPOSE: Pre-prepared prompt for efficient session initiation.
Updated after each session closeout.

7.3 SESSION NAMING CONVENTION
Format: [session#] [PROJECT-HANDLE] ([semantic descriptor])
Examples:
- 001 CLGYSING (Rooting and Project Architecture)
- 023 AWSNBLM (File Fix and Index Alpha)

CRITICAL: User must rename chat in Claude UI to match this convention.
Default AI-generated name must be replaced.

7.4 FILE ORGANIZATION
Project folder structure:
- /[Project Name]/
  - /Chats/
    - /[Branch Handle]/
      - /[Session Name]/  (each session gets its own folder)
        - Bootstrap, session log, all artifacts, transcript
  - /Decision Logs/
    - /[Branch Handle]/
  - /Artifacts/
    - Organized by phase, type, or function
    - WIP reports, specs, research docs
  - /Guides/
    - Project guides, reference documents
  - /Phase Protocols/
    - Current phase protocol(s) at top level
    - /Old/  (superseded versions archived here)
  - /[Other as needed]/
    - Source materials, raw notes, etc.

7.5 POST-SESSION HOUSEKEEPING
1. Download all artifacts (use Claude's "show all artifacts" button)
2. Put all downloads in session folder
3. Open bootstrap — verify:
   - Session number correct (sometimes increments by 2)
   - Branch handle name correct (sometimes confused across branches)
   - If incorrect, note correction in new chat notepad
4. Copy new chat name from bootstrap → new chat notepad
5. Download transcript (via Claude Exporter or equivalent)
6. Put transcript in session folder
7. Upload to NotebookLM:
   - Transcript → project notebook
   - Non-ephemeral artifacts → project notebook
   - Re-sync if using Google Docs consolidation

7.6 PRE-SESSION HOUSEKEEPING
1. New chat notepad has been updated with:
   - Correct chat name
   - Standard opening line
   - Notebook references
   - Behavioral reminders
   - Any between-session context
2. Copy entire notepad content
3. Start new chat in project (with Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge)
4. Paste notepad content
5. Attach: bootstrap + session log + any needed files
6. Copy chat name to clipboard
7. Hit send
8. Wait for response to begin loading
9. Rename chat to match convention (paste from clipboard or notepad)
10. Create new session folder in chats directory

7.7 PROMPTING DISCIPLINE
- Compose responses in external notepad (prevents accidental sends)
- When providing input on decisions, use the formula:
  [State your thinking] + [Provide direction] + "Let me know if you
  think there's a better way or if my thinking is incorrect"
- Explicitly invite AI to disagree/suggest alternatives
- Without invitation, AI defaults to compliance

7.8 NOTEBOOKLM MAINTENANCE
- Upload transcripts and non-ephemeral artifacts between sessions
- When Claude needs context not in loaded files, direct it:
  "The information you're looking for is likely in the NotebookLM
  notebook. Please begin targeted queries and ask as many questions
  as you need."
- Encourage exhaustive querying process

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. User behavior callouts embedded throughout relevant sections
2. Potentially a companion User Guide document (separate deliverable)
3. Quick-reference cheat sheet for pre/post session workflows
4. Troubleshooting section for common user-side issues

================================================================================
CATEGORY 8: CONNECTOR TRANSPARENCY PROTOCOL
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual predates MCP tool usage

FIELD FINDING:
When Claude uses MCP tools (like NotebookLM queries), the actions happen
behind the scenes and don't appear in the transcript. This creates
"transcript gaps" that break auditability and backtracing.

PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS:
For every MCP tool invocation, AI must narrate in the chat:
1. TOOL IDENTIFICATION: Which tool is being called
2. QUERY DETAILS: What parameters/prompts are being used
3. INTENT: Why this query is being made
4. RESULT SUMMARY: Representative sample of the output
5. ASSESSMENT: Brief evaluation of result quality/relevance

PURPOSE: Ensures transcript captures the full picture of what happened,
enabling future context recovery and quality assessment.

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. New subsection in tools/adjunct section
2. Behavioral requirement added to session lifecycle
3. Example of proper transparency narration
4. Connection to session log (tool calls recorded in response index)

================================================================================
CATEGORY 9: INSIGHT CAPTURE / OUT-OF-PHASE BACKLOG
================================================================================
Type: NEW — No equivalent in current manual

FIELD FINDING:
A formal mechanism for capturing valuable ideas that arise outside current
phase scope. Prevents scope creep while ensuring nothing valuable is lost.

TWO-PHASE WORKFLOW:
Phase 1 — Capture (In-Session):
1. Out-of-scope idea arises
2. AI auto-detects or user flags
3. Brief containable survey (3-5 questions)
4. Generates Backlog Item Report with provenance data
5. Work continues on current scope

Phase 2 — Evaluation & Routing (Dedicated Session):
1. Review accumulated backlog items
2. Evaluate each item
3. Route to appropriate place:
   - New component/feature
   - Future task
   - Specific document update
   - Discard (not actionable)

BACKLOG ITEM SCHEMA:
- Backlog-Item-[NNN]
- Description
- Context (what triggered it)
- Potential impact
- Suggested routing
- Priority assessment
- Status: CAPTURED → EVALUATED → ROUTED

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. New subsection in session management or advanced patterns
2. Backlog Item template
3. Behavioral guidance for AI (auto-detect scope expansion)
4. Connection to scope monitoring duty

================================================================================
CATEGORY 10: PHASE TRANSITION REFINEMENTS
================================================================================
Type: REFINEMENT of existing manual content

8-STEP PHASE TRANSITION PROCESS:
1. ASSESS current position and readiness
2. CONSOLIDATE completed scope (gather logs, SFRs, decision logs)
3. SYNTHESIZE insights, decisions, outcomes (husk removal)
4. REVIEW deferred items
5. DEFINE upcoming phase scope
6. UPDATE Phase Protocol (redraft if needed)
7. UPDATE rolling records (decisions, terminology, cross-references)
8. GENERATE transition artifacts (bootstrap, transition summary)

HUSK VS. COCONUT PRINCIPLE:
- HUSK: Conversational filler, rejected hypotheses, exploratory tangents,
  unanswered questions, superseded options — REMOVE
- COCONUT: Finalized decisions, crystallized conclusions, validated
  methodologies, confirmed scope boundaries — KEEP

SINE WAVE MODEL:
- Peaks = active phase work
- Zero-crossings = phase transitions
- Transition sessions are planning-heavy, execution-light

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Formalize 8-step process
2. Husk/coconut filtering guidance
3. Sine wave model as mental model
4. Phase Protocol redrafting triggers
5. Transition session expectations

================================================================================
CATEGORY 11: OPERATIONAL REFINEMENTS
================================================================================
Type: REFINEMENT — Integrate into appropriate existing sections

11.1 CEREMONY IS CONTINUITY
Philosophy: Formal artifact creation IS the continuity mechanism for AI
work. Because AI resets every session, the ceremonial production of
bootstraps, session logs, and SFRs creates the "external memory" that
enables coherent multi-session projects.

11.2 CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL
When protocol behaviors conflict with project objectives:
1. STOP all work immediately
2. FLAG the conflict explicitly to user
3. EXPLAIN which protocol behavior creates the conflict
4. PROPOSE resolution options (modify approach, segment work, defer)
5. AWAIT user decision before proceeding
6. DOCUMENT decision

CRITICAL: Project objectives ALWAYS override protocol convenience.

11.3 INSTRUCTION CHAIN INTERPRETATION
Multi-step instructions interpreted as sequential with alignment checkpoints:
- "Do X, then Y, then close out" means:
  - Do X → Ask "X done. Proceed to Y?" → Do Y → Ask "Ready to close out?"
- NOT: Execute X → Y → closeout automatically

Exception: Within explicitly aligned scope, routine execution proceeds
without per-step confirmation.

11.4 SCOPE MONITORING DUTY
AI must:
- DETECT when requested work extends beyond defined phase scope
- PAUSE and FLAG scope questions BEFORE proceeding
- PROPOSE options: update scope, adjust request, or backlog item
- NEVER silently expand scope

11.5 ALIGNMENT OVER ASSUMPTION
"Propose and pause beats assume and proceed"
- Explicit confirmation over inferred continuation
- User initiation for major transitions
- AI proposes options, user decides direction

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Weave ceremony/continuity philosophy into foundations
2. Add conflict resolution as formal protocol
3. Add instruction chain interpretation rules
4. Enhance scope monitoring guidance
5. Reinforce alignment over assumption throughout

================================================================================
CATEGORY 12: THREE-TIER DOCUMENTATION ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Pattern for managing documentation in complex projects

THREE TIERS:
1. Architecture References (System Level):
   - High-level blueprints, design philosophy, component interrelations
   - Stable across project
   - "Single source of truth"

2. Per-Tool/Component References (Operational Level):
   - Granular specs for specific tools, components, processes
   - Bridges architecture to execution
   - Updated when tools/components change

3. CHANGELOGs (Temporal Level):
   - Track evolution over time
   - Version history, decisions, progression
   - "Context continuity" for future sessions

PURPOSE: Prevents information overload by separating concerns.
AI agent executing a task needs only the relevant operational reference
and current changelog, not the entire system history.

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Introduce as a pattern for complex projects
2. Guidance on when each tier is appropriate
3. Examples of each tier
4. Connection to file naming conventions

================================================================================
CATEGORY 13: KNOWN FAILURE MODES & WORKAROUNDS
================================================================================
Type: NEW/REFINEMENT — Extend existing failure mode catalog

13.1 BOOTSTRAP VERIFICATION FAILURES
- Session number incrementing by 2 instead of 1
- Branch handle name confusion across branches sharing Phase Protocol
- Context compaction errors in long sessions corrupting closeout artifacts

Workaround: User verification of every bootstrap (see Category 7.5)

13.2 AI BEHAVIORAL FORGETFULNESS
Despite encoding in Phase Protocols, session logs, and dedicated documents,
certain behaviors need explicit reminders in session startup message:
- Connector transparency (narrating MCP tool calls)
- Specific formatting requirements
- Project-specific conventions

Root cause: Session isolation (tabula rasa), cached tool manifests,
context window compaction in long sessions.

Workaround: Include behavioral reminders in new chat notepad startup
message every session.

13.3 EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE CONTAMINATION
AI draws from training data rather than specific source material.
Hallucinated connections that aren't in the provided text.

Workaround: Strict source boundary enforcement in prompts.

13.4 SYNTHESIS LAYER DEGRADATION
Extraction fidelity (NotebookLM layer) high, but synthesis errors
(Claude layer) can introduce categorical errors during multi-query synthesis.

Workaround: Verification protocols, cross-checking results.

13.5 CONTEXT INVISIBILITY (TRANSCRIPT GAPS)
MCP tool calls invisible in transcript. If session crashes before AI
saves data, information permanently lost.

Workaround: Connector Transparency Protocol (Category 8).

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Extend failure mode catalog with field-tested failure modes
2. User-side verification procedures
3. Workaround documentation for each failure mode

================================================================================
CATEGORY 14: INTER-BRANCH COMMUNICATION
================================================================================
Type: NEW — Manual has no concept of cross-branch coordination

FIELD FINDING:
When multiple branches run under one project, they occasionally need to
share information. One branch's outputs become another branch's inputs.

CROSS-BRANCH AWARENESS DOCUMENT:
A document that sits alongside the Phase Protocol in project knowledge:
- Lists all active branches and their objectives
- Notes coordination needs between branches
- Updated when branches are created, completed, or when significant
  cross-branch dependencies emerge
- Gives every session awareness of what other branches are doing

CROSS-BRANCH CONTEXT SHARING MECHANISMS:
1. Upload relevant artifacts from one branch's notebook to another's
2. Shared main project notebook (all branches can access)
3. Cross-branch awareness document in project knowledge
4. During rooting/branch-startup, explicitly map inter-branch dependencies

CONTENT REQUIRED IN MANUAL:
1. Cross-branch awareness document concept and template
2. Coordination patterns between branches
3. When to share context vs. when branches operate independently
4. Connection to notebook organization strategy

================================================================================
APPENDIX A: PRIORITY SEQUENCE
================================================================================

Drafting will proceed in this order:

 1. Phase Protocol concept — new dedicated section + weave throughout
 2. Rooting as Phase 0 — formalize in project lifecycle
 3. Enhanced session lifecycle — response indexing, alignment turn,
    closeout, SFR, headroom opportunism, segmentation
 4. NotebookLM / notebook integration — deep context recovery
 5. Findings Reports — new artifact class
 6. Branch management — formal concept, branch startup, mini-rooting
 7. User behaviors — all user-facing guidance
 8. Connector transparency protocol — new subsection
 9. Insight capture / out-of-phase backlog — new subsection
10. Phase transition refinements — 8-step process, husk/coconut
11. Operational refinements — ceremony, conflict resolution, instruction
    chain, scope monitoring, alignment over assumption
12. Three-tier documentation architecture — reference pattern
13. Known failure modes — bootstrap verification, behavioral forgetfulness,
    contamination, degradation, transcript gaps
14. Inter-branch communication — cross-branch awareness

================================================================================
APPENDIX B: VOLUME DIVISION STRATEGY
================================================================================

For drafting convenience, the manual may be split at logical points.
Proposed natural divisions (flexible, to emerge during drafting):

Volume 1: Foundations & Philosophy
- Parts I, core concepts, Three Cycles Framework
- Ceremony is continuity philosophy
- Alignment over assumption principle

Volume 2: Project Management
- Phase Protocol, Rooting, Session Lifecycle, Continuity
- Response indexing, alignment turns, closeout
- Phase transitions, branching

Volume 3: Governance & Tools
- Governance integration, tool patterns
- Notebook integration, connector transparency
- Findings reports, insight capture

Volume 4: Advanced Patterns & Reference

APPENDIX D: DECISIONS MADE THIS SESSION
================================================================================

D-032-001: VERSION TARGET
Decision: Target version is v1.0.8-DRAFT (not v1.1.0 or v2.0)
Rationale: Significant improvements but want more testing before formal
v1.1.0 crystallized beta. v1.0.8 reflects iterative refinement.
Status: ACTIVE

D-032-002: DRAFTING APPROACH
Decision: Section-by-section revision with segmented drafting across
multiple sessions, following priority sequence in Appendix A.
Rationale: Manual is 13,257 lines; cannot be revised in single session.
Segmentation prevents headroom exhaustion.
Status: ACTIVE

D-032-003: VOLUME SEGMENTATION
Decision: Split manual at logical points for drafting convenience.
Not a fundamental restructure — primarily for token management.
Rationale: User requested; also potentially useful for user accessibility.
Status: ACTIVE

D-032-004: TOOL-AGNOSTIC APPROACH
Decision: Manual references "notebook connectivity tool" generically
rather than Majeston specifically. Tool-agnostic with concrete examples.
Rationale: Manual should remain applicable regardless of specific
MCP tool implementation.
Status: ACTIVE

D-032-005: USER GUIDE AS SEPARATE DELIVERABLE
Decision: User behaviors embedded as callouts in manual revision;
standalone User Guide deferred as separate deliverable.
Rationale: Manual revision is primary scope; User Guide is substantial
enough to warrant dedicated development.
Status: ACTIVE

D-032-006: FINDINGS REPORT AS ARTIFACT CLASS
Decision: Formalize Findings Reports as a distinct artifact class
with F## indexing, template, and behavioral guidance.
Rationale: Field testing demonstrated clear need for synthesis-oriented
discovery documentation distinct from session logs and decision logs.
Status: ACTIVE
