PURPOSE
================================================================================

This document maps every revision required for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT,
organized into discrete drafting sessions. Each session entry specifies:
- Target sections (what's being created or revised)
- Content scope (new material, enhancements, integration points)
- Research needs (notebook queries, examples to pull)
- Dependencies (what must be done first)
- Quality audit targets (existing thin content to enhance)
- Templates affected (new or revised templates)
- "Done" criteria (what completion looks like)

Governing decisions:
- D-032-001: Version target is v1.0.8-DRAFT
- D-032-002: Section-by-section segmented drafting
- D-032-003: Volume segmentation for drafting convenience
- D-032-004: Tool-agnostic approach (generic notebook connectivity)
- D-032-005: User Guide as separate deliverable
- D-032-006: Findings Reports as artifact class
- D-033-001: Comprehensive quality pass on all touched sections

DRAFTING SESSION PLAN
================================================================================

Each drafting session targets 1-2 categories from the priority sequence,
plus quality audit of any existing sections being touched.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAFTING SESSION A: Phase Protocol + Rooting as Phase 0
Categories: 1, 2
Estimated complexity: HIGH
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TARGET SECTIONS — NEW CONTENT:

1. Section 5.2 Phase Protocol (NEW — substantial subsection)
   Content scope:
   - Concept introduction and purpose
   - Three-layer architecture (AIPM Framework / System-Methodology / 
     Project-Specific) with explanation of each layer
   - Relationship diagram: Project Guide → Phase Protocol → Bootstrap
   - Phase Protocol lifecycle: creation during rooting, stability within
     phase, redrafting at phase transitions
   - Addendum pattern: when to redraft vs. when to create addendum
   - Project Knowledge storage and the bootstrap-as-prompt-list dynamic
     (files in Project Knowledge aren't auto-read; bootstrap must
     explicitly instruct AI to review them)
   - Mandatory review at session start (behavioral requirement)
   - "Ceremony is continuity" philosophy as it applies to Phase Protocol
   - When to create vs. when to skip (if behaviors don't change between
     phases)
   - Phase Protocol redrafting triggers and 8-step process reference
   - Cross-branch inheritance (branches inherit parent Phase Protocol)
   
   Quality standard: This must be one of the richest subsections in
   Section 5 — comparable depth to or exceeding the current Project Guide
   subsection. The Phase Protocol is the most significant new artifact
   class and deserves commensurate treatment.

2. Section 2.5.1 Project Lifecycle — Rooting as Phase 0 (REVISION)
   Content scope:
   - Formalize rooting as Phase 0 with defined activities, outputs,
     exit criteria
   - Step-by-step rooting process guide
   - Sine wave model as mental model for project rhythm
   - "If rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions"
   - Rooting produces: Project Guide + Base Phase Protocol
   - Connection to existing Project Readiness Assessment (1.4.5)
   - Example: research project rooting walkthrough
   
3. Section 1.4.6 User Workflow Overview (REVISION)
   Content scope:
   - Update to reflect Phase 0 / rooting as the entry point
   - Reference Phase Protocol creation as part of project startup

TARGET SECTIONS — INTEGRATION POINTS:

4. Section 4.3 Session Lifecycle (ADD REFERENCES)
   - Session initiation: add Phase Protocol review as mandatory first
     action
   - Phase transitions: reference Phase Protocol redrafting

5. Section 5.1 Project Guide (QUALITY AUDIT + ENHANCEMENT)
   - Review current content for adequacy
   - Add explicit relationship to Phase Protocol
   - Clarify: Project Guide = project-stable; Phase Protocol = phase-stable

6. Section 5.5 Bootstrap Files (new number; QUALITY AUDIT + ENHANCEMENT)
   - Review current content against field-tested bootstrap practices
   - Add: bootstrap as prompt-list concept (explicit instructions to
     review Project Knowledge files)
   - Add: bootstrap-Phase Protocol relationship ("cousins")
   - Add: stable vs. dynamic bootstrap elements
   - Assess whether TPL-002 needs revision or replacement

7. Section 5.8 Artifact Relationships (new number; UPDATE)
   - Add Phase Protocol to the artifact relationship map
   - Update hierarchy: Project Guide → Phase Protocol → Bootstrap

TEMPLATES:
   - NEW: TPL-0XX Phase Protocol Template
   - NEW: TPL-0XX Phase Protocol Addendum Template

     (v1.2_PP_CLGYSING-PHASE_1) for template extraction
   - Optionally: request user provide 2-3 recent bootstraps as examples
     of evolved practice

DEPENDENCIES: None — this is the foundation everything else builds on.

     lifecycle, addendum pattern, and behavioral requirements
   □ Section 2.5.1 updated with Phase 0 / rooting formalization

================================================================================
SESSION SEQUENCING AND DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

Session A ──→ Session B ──→ Session C ──→ Session D ──→ Session E ──→ Session F ──→ Session G
(Phase       (Session     (Notebook +  (Artifacts + (Transitions+ (User        (Templates+
Protocol +   Lifecycle)   Connector)   Branches)    Operational)  Behaviors +  Integration)
Rooting)                                                          Failure Modes)

Sessions A and B are foundational — everything else builds on them.
Sessions C, D, E can potentially be reordered if needed, but the
proposed sequence minimizes rework.
Session F depends on all prior content existing for callout placement.
Session G is always last.

================================================================================
BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATE FOR DRAFTING SESSIONS
================================================================================

Each drafting session bootstrap should include:
- Reference to this Drafting Plan (file name and target session letter)
- The specific "TARGET SECTIONS" from the relevant session entry
- The "RESEARCH NEEDS" for that session
- The "DONE CRITERIA" as completion checklist
- Reference to 032_FINDINGS document for detailed content specs
- Current state of any prior session outputs (what's been drafted)
- Any decisions or changes made in intervening sessions

================================================================================
RISK REGISTER
================================================================================

1. TOKEN EXHAUSTION DURING COMPLEX SESSIONS
   Mitigation: Conservative scoping per session; headroom monitoring;
   willingness to split sessions further if needed.

2. RENUMBERING CASCADE
   Risk: Section 5 renumbering creates ripple of cross-reference updates.
   Mitigation: Track all cross-references; Session G dedicated to this.

3. CONTENT DRIFT
   Risk: Later sessions' content doesn't align with earlier sessions.
   Mitigation: This plan + Findings document as dual authority;
   each session reviews prior outputs before drafting.

4. TEMPLATE PROLIFERATION
   Risk: Too many templates makes system unwieldy.
   Mitigation: Evaluate each template for necessity; combine where logical.

5. DUAL-AUDIENCE TENSION
   Risk: Content that's optimal for AI reference may not be optimal for
   user education, and vice versa.
   Mitigation: Clearly marked user callouts; consistent depth standard;
   User Guide as separate deliverable handles the education gap.

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- This plan covers 7 drafting sessions (A through G)
- Actual session count may vary (sessions can split if scope exceeds
  headroom, or consolidate if work moves quickly)
- The Findings document (032_FINDINGS_GOV-AIPM-Revision-Plan.txt)
  remains the authoritative source for WHAT to draft
- This Drafting Plan is the authoritative source for WHEN and WHERE
- Both documents should be uploaded to every drafting session
- After each drafting session, this plan should be updated with
  completion status and any scope adjustments

================================================================================
END OF DRAFTING PLAN
================================================================================
