TPL-0XX: FINDINGS REPORT

Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-0XX
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Structured capture of empirical discoveries organized by topic.
         Preserves observations, evidence, and implications in a format
         designed for high queryability and evidence-to-decision tracing.
When to Use: During or after sessions involving research, exploration,
             evaluation, testing, or any work producing empirical
             observations that warrant structured capture.

Cross-reference: Section 5.6 (Findings Reports), Section 5.3 (Decision
Logs), Section 10.3 (Notebook Connectivity)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete a Findings Report when a session produces empirical discoveries
that go beyond routine execution. The report captures what was observed,
what evidence supports it, and what it means for the project.

WHEN TO USE:
- Research or exploration sessions
- Evaluation, testing, or validation sessions
- Field testing or beta testing sessions
- Any session producing significant empirical observations

WHEN NOT NEEDED:
- Pure execution sessions (drafting, formatting, assembly)
- Administrative sessions (file organization, project setup)
- Sessions where no empirical observations emerged

The AI may propose Findings Report generation mid-session when it
recognizes a pattern of empirical discovery. The user approves, defers
to closeout, or declines.

INDEXING:
Finding IDs (F-##) accumulate across the entire project and never
reset. Check the prior Findings Report or Session Log for the last
used F-## number. If this is the project's first Findings Report,
begin at F-01.

FILE NAMING:
[###]_findings.txt or [###]_findings_[topic].txt
Examples: 012_findings.txt, 032_findings_beta-test-review.txt

DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:
The AI generates this template as part of the session workflow. Say:
"Let's capture findings" or "Start a Findings Report" to initiate.
The AI may also propose generation proactively.

Tips:
- Write discoveries as standalone statements — a reader should
  understand each finding without additional context
- Be specific in evidence — reference sessions, response indexes,
  or external sources
- Separate observation (Discovery) from interpretation (Impact)
- Use standard verdicts where they fit; create custom verdicts when
  needed

FINDINGS REPORT — Session [###]

================================================================================
REPORT CONTEXT
================================================================================

[Brief description of the research, exploration, or testing activity
that produced these findings. What was being investigated and why?
2-4 sentences providing enough context for a reader encountering this
report independently.]

================================================================================
FINDINGS
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
F-[##]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discovery:
[Concise statement of the observation or insight. Specific enough to
stand alone. 1-3 sentences.]

Evidence:
[Specific data points, test results, source references, or observations
that support the discovery. Reference sessions, response indexes, or
external sources as appropriate.]

Impact / Implication:
[How this finding affects the project — its pipeline, methodology,
deliverables, or thesis. What changes or should change because of
this discovery?]

Status / Verdict:
[VALIDATED | GAP IDENTIFIED | REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING | CONTRADICTS |
INFORMS DECISION | NOTED | or custom verdict]

PROVENANCE
================================================================================

Research Method:    [How discoveries were made — testing, comparative
                    analysis, field observation, literature review, etc.]
Sources Consulted:  [Notebooks queried, documents reviewed, tools tested]
Sessions Spanned:   [If findings draw from multiple sessions, list them]
Related Decisions:  [Any D-### decisions that these findings informed
                    or were informed by]

TEMPLATE NOTES
================================================================================

DESIGN RATIONALE:

The template prioritizes queryability. Each finding is a self-contained
block with a unique ID, making it highly effective as a notebook source.
A query for "F-14" or "findings about token exhaustion" returns
precisely structured results.

The five-field schema separates observation from interpretation:
- Discovery and Evidence are empirical (what was seen)
- Impact/Implication is analytical (what it means)
- Status/Verdict is evaluative (what to do about it)

This separation prevents a common failure mode where observations are
conflated with conclusions, making it difficult to re-evaluate findings
when project context changes.

CUMULATIVE INDEX:

The cumulative index at the bottom of each report serves two purposes:
1. Running directory of all project findings for quick reference
2. High-value notebook source — a single document that enables targeted
   retrieval across the entire findings corpus

For long-running projects, the cumulative index may be maintained as a
separate standalone file ([PROJECT]_cumulative-findings-index.txt) to
avoid excessive growth within individual reports. In this case,
individual reports may omit the cumulative index section and
cross-reference the standalone file.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TEMPLATES:

The Findings Report relates to:
- TPL-005 (Session Log): The Session Log notes findings generated
  during the session. The Findings Report provides the full structured
  record. Both reference the same F-## identifiers.
- Decision Log: Findings inform decisions. The Findings Report's
  "Related Decisions" field and the Decision Log's rationale section
  create bidirectional traceability.
- TPL-002 (Bootstrap): The Bootstrap may note outstanding findings
  requiring follow-up in the next session.

STANDARD VERDICTS:

| Verdict                    | Meaning                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| VALIDATED                  | Confirms an approach, tool, or hypothesis   |
| GAP IDENTIFIED             | Reveals a missing capability or content      |
| REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING   | Promising but inconclusive                  |
| CONTRADICTS                | Contradicts a prior assumption or approach   |
| INFORMS DECISION           | Provides evidence for a pending choice       |
| NOTED                      | Recorded for reference, no immediate action  |

Custom verdicts are acceptable when standard options do not fit the
finding's nature.
