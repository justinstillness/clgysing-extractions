DRAFT — INTEGRATION POINTS FOR SESSION F CONTENT
================================================================================
Target:     Multiple existing sections and prior drafts in GOV-AIPM
Drafted:    Session 038
Categories: 7 (User Behaviors), 12 (Three-Tier Architecture),
            13 (Failure Modes), 14 (Inter-Branch Communication)
            — integration weave
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

These are targeted insertions and modifications that create the
cross-reference web connecting Session F content to the rest of the
manual and to prior session drafts.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 1: Section 1.4.6 User Workflow — Callout System
Location: Session A draft Section 1.4.6
Action: ADD note about user behavior callouts as a navigation aid
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to the introductory text of Section 1.4.6 (or in a suitable
location within the user workflow overview):

Throughout this manual, USER ACTION and USER BEHAVIOR callouts mark the
specific points where user-side actions are required. These callouts
are embedded within AI-facing sections — at the exact workflow point
where the user responsibility occurs. Look for the bordered callout
boxes within Sections 3, 4, 6, and 10 for the complete set of user-
side guidance.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 2: Section 2.7 AI Coordinator Duties — Branch
                      Awareness
Location: Section 2.7.8 "What Users Should Expect" (or suitable
          location within AI duties)
Action: ADD cross-branch awareness as an AI coordination duty
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to the existing duty list or expectation list:

- For projects with active branches, the AI will proactively identify
  cross-branch implications of current work and suggest appropriate
  communication actions (Awareness Document updates, bootstrap
  notifications, or integration sessions)

Cross-reference: Section 12.3.10 (Inter-Branch Communication Protocol).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 3: Section 4.3.3 Closeout — Branch Duties
Location: Session B draft Section 4.3.3, USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES list
Action: ADD branch-specific post-session duty
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to the USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES list (after notebook upload bullet):

- For projects with active branches: update the Cross-Branch Awareness
  Document if this session changed branch status, dependencies, or
  coordination needs; upload cross-relevant artifacts to the main
  notebook; note any bootstrap notifications needed for other branches
  (see Section 12.3.10)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 4: Section 5.5 Bootstrap Files — Branch Notifications
Location: Session A Integration Point 4 content (Bootstrap section),
          within the "stable content" description
Action: ADD branch notification as a Bootstrap content category
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to the Bootstrap stable content or dynamic content description
(depending on whether notifications are recurring or per-session):

For branched projects, the Bootstrap may include cross-branch
notifications — information from other branches that this session
needs to be aware of. These are generated by the user based on
outcomes from other branch sessions and the Cross-Branch Awareness
Document. See Section 12.3.10 for the notification protocol.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 5: Section 6.1 Naming Conventions — Three-Tier
Location: Section 6.1 (existing naming conventions content)
Action: ADD Three-Tier naming conventions reference
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD (brief note within or after the file naming conventions):

For projects using the Three-Tier Documentation Architecture
(Section 12.4), additional naming conventions apply:
- Tier 1: [VERSION]_SPEC_[System]-Architecture-Reference.[ext]
- Tier 2: [VERSION]_REF_[Component]-Reference.[ext]
- Tier 3: CHANGELOG.[ext] or [PROJECT]_CHANGELOG.[ext]

These conventions extend the project's standard naming rules with
tier-specific prefixes for immediate identification.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 6: Section 12.2 Complex Project Management
Location: Section 12.2 (existing content — unchanged from v1.0.7)
Action: ADD cross-reference to Three-Tier Architecture and Branch
        Management
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD at end of Section 12.2 or as a transitional paragraph:

For projects requiring structured documentation management, see
Section 12.4 (Three-Tier Documentation Architecture). For projects
requiring parallel workstream management, see Section 12.3 (Branch
Management). These patterns extend the complex project management
principles described in this section with specific operational
protocols.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 7: Table of Contents
Location: Lines 1-160 (TOC in v1.0.7)
Action: ADD new sections to TOC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to Section 12 TOC entries (after 12.3):
    12.4 Three-Tier Documentation Architecture

NOTE: Section 14 entries do not require TOC changes — the new failure
modes are additions within existing subsection 14.1, not new
subsections.

NOTE: User Behavior callouts are embedded within existing sections and
do not require separate TOC entries.


========================================================================
INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

ORDERING:
These integration points should be applied during Session G along with
all integration points from Sessions A-E. They are non-destructive
additions except where explicitly noted.

Integration Point 3 modifies Session B's Section 4.3.3 draft content
(USER CLOSEOUT DUTIES list). Session G should apply the Session B
revision first, then this addition.

Integration Point 4 layers onto Session A's Integration Point 4
(Bootstrap section). Session G should apply both together.

SESSION F DRAFT FILE CROSS-REFERENCE:
| Integration Point | Related Draft File                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1 (User Workflow) | DRAFT_User-Behavior-Callouts                    |
| 2 (AI Duties)     | DRAFT_Section_12-3_Inter-Branch-Communication   |
| 3 (Closeout)      | DRAFT_Section_12-3_Inter-Branch-Communication   |
| 4 (Bootstrap)     | DRAFT_Section_12-3_Inter-Branch-Communication   |
| 5 (Naming)        | DRAFT_Section_12-4_Three-Tier-Architecture      |
| 6 (Complex PM)    | DRAFT_Section_12-4_Three-Tier-Architecture      |
| 7 (TOC)           | DRAFT_Section_12-4_Three-Tier-Architecture      |

CUMULATIVE INTEGRATION POINT COUNT:
- Session A: 8 integration points
- Session B: 0 (self-contained revisions)
- Session C: 0 (self-contained additions)
- Session D: 4 integration points
- Session E: 8 integration points
- Session F: 7 integration points (this document)
- Total: 27 integration points for Session G

NOTE ON SESSION G COMPLEXITY:
The cumulative integration point count has grown from 20 (end of
Session E) to 27. The Session E bootstrap noted that Session G may
need to be split into G1 (integration) and G2 (templates + final
pass). This growth strengthens that recommendation.
