DRAFT — TPL-001 REVISION NOTES AND NEW CONTENT
================================================================================
Target:     TPL-001 Project Initiation Form in Appendix A
Drafted:    Session 033
Category:   2 (Rooting as Phase 0) from Revision Findings
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

REVISION APPROACH:

The current TPL-001 is functional and well-structured. Rather than a full
rewrite, this revision makes targeted changes to align it with the
rooting (Phase 0) formalization and Phase Protocol creation process.

The core form fields (Sections 1-13) remain largely intact — they capture
the right information. The revisions focus on:
1. Reframing the form as part of the rooting process, not a standalone
   prerequisite
2. Adding Phase Protocol awareness
3. Adding phase structure planning
4. Updating the instructions and dialog completion guidance
5. Adding rooting exit criteria

================================================================================
REVISION 1: UPDATE HEADER AND PURPOSE
================================================================================

REPLACE existing header block:

TPL-001: PROJECT INITIATION FORM

Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-001
Version: 2.0
Purpose: Structures the rooting process (Phase 0) for new AI-assisted
         projects. Captures project parameters and establishes shared
         expectations. Serves as the foundation for Project Guide and
         Phase Protocol creation.
When to Use: At the start of any new AI-assisted project or major
             workstream, as part of the rooting (Phase 0) process.

Cross-reference: Section 2.5.1 (Rooting / Phase 0), Section 5.1
(Project Guide), Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol)


================================================================================
REVISION 2: UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

REPLACE existing instructions block:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This form structures the rooting process for a new project. Rooting
(Phase 0) is the deliberate process of establishing a project's
foundation before execution begins. It produces two foundational
outputs: a Project Guide and a Base Phase Protocol.

HOW TO USE THIS FORM:

Option A — Pre-Completion: Complete as much of this form as you can
before your first AI session. Provide the partially or fully completed
form along with this manual at session start. The AI will review your
inputs and engage in collaborative dialog to fill gaps, probe
assumptions, and refine the project definition.

Option B — Collaborative Dialog: Provide this manual and any relevant
materials at session start. Tell the AI: "I'd like to root a new
project" or "Help me complete TPL-001." The AI will walk through each
section collaboratively, asking targeted questions to build the project
definition together.

Either option leads to the same outcome: a verified Project Guide and
Base Phase Protocol. Option B is recommended for complex projects where
assumptions need testing through dialog.

IMPORTANT: Rooting is design work, not form completion. Expect 10-20
substantive exchanges where the AI probes your thinking, surfaces gaps,
and proposes alternatives. This investment in foundation-building pays
dividends throughout the project. If rooting takes multiple sessions,
that is normal for complex projects.

Tips:
- Be specific about scope boundaries — what's OUT is as important as
  what's IN
- Define the destination before mapping the journey — what does "done"
  look like?
- Specify deliverable formats so the AI knows what to produce
- Include any constraints the AI should know about
- Think about phase structure — how does the work naturally divide?

See Section 3.5 for the Dialog Intake System.


================================================================================
REVISION 3: ADD NEW SECTION — PHASE STRUCTURE (insert after Section 6)
================================================================================

ADD as new Section 6A (renumber subsequent sections):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6A. PHASE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does this project's work naturally divide into phases? Each phase
should have distinct objectives and produce specific outputs.

NOTE: This section may be developed collaboratively with the AI during
rooting. You do not need to have phases fully defined before starting.

Phase 0 — Rooting: [This phase — produces Project Guide and Phase
Protocol. Already underway if you're completing this form.]

Phase 1 — _______________________________________________
Objectives: ______________________________________________
Key Deliverables: ________________________________________
Estimated Sessions: ______________________________________
Exit Criteria: ___________________________________________

Phase 2 — _______________________________________________
Objectives: ______________________________________________
Key Deliverables: ________________________________________
Estimated Sessions: ______________________________________
Exit Criteria: ___________________________________________

Phase 3 — _______________________________________________
Objectives: ______________________________________________
Key Deliverables: ________________________________________
Estimated Sessions: ______________________________________
Exit Criteria: ___________________________________________

[Add additional phases as needed]

Dependencies between phases:

================================================================================
REVISION 4: ADD NEW SECTION — METHODOLOGY (insert after Phase Structure)
================================================================================

ADD as new Section 6B (renumber subsequent sections):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6B. METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What methodology or approach will this project use? This information
feeds into Layer 2 of the Phase Protocol.

Project Type:
[ ] Research / Writing
[ ] Software Development
[ ] Governance / Policy Development
[ ] Consulting / Advisory
[ ] Creative
[ ] Technical / Engineering
[ ] Other: ___________________________________________________________________

Known Methodology or Framework:
(If you have a specific methodology in mind, describe it. If not, the AI
will help identify an appropriate approach during rooting.)

Collaboration Model:
What is your role vs. the AI's role in this project?
Your role: __________________________________________________________________
AI's role: __________________________________________________________________


================================================================================
REVISION 5: ADD NEW SECTION — NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY (insert in
            appropriate location, likely near Reference Materials)
================================================================================

ADD as new section:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XX. NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will this project use a notebook connectivity tool for deep context
recovery between sessions?

[ ] Yes — notebook already exists
    Notebook ID: _____________________________________________________________
    Contents: ________________________________________________________________

[ ] Yes — will create during rooting
[ ] No — not needed for this project
[ ] Unsure — discuss during rooting

If using notebook connectivity, note the upload plan:
[ ] Upload transcripts after each session
[ ] Upload non-ephemeral artifacts after each session
[ ] Use consolidated Google Doc approach for source efficiency
[ ] Other: ___________________________________________________________________


================================================================================
REVISION 6: UPDATE FORM COMPLETION SECTION
================================================================================

REPLACE existing "FORM COMPLETE" section:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORM COMPLETE — ROOTING OUTPUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide this form to the AI at the start of your rooting session along
with this manual and any relevant reference materials.

ROOTING EXIT CRITERIA:
Before rooting (Phase 0) is complete, verify:

[ ] Project Guide exists and captures all essential project parameters
[ ] Base Phase Protocol exists with all three layers:
    [ ] Layer 1: AIPM Framework Behaviors
    [ ] Layer 2: Methodology/Approach Context
    [ ] Layer 3: Project-Specific Context
[ ] Phase structure is defined with objectives and exit criteria
[ ] First execution phase scope is clear
[ ] Phase Protocol is stored in Project Knowledge
[ ] Bootstrap for first execution session is generated
[ ] Bootstrap includes mandatory first action to review Phase Protocol
[ ] All foundational decisions are documented

After rooting is complete, ask the AI:
- "Have we covered everything needed to begin Phase 1?"
- "Are there any open items or assumptions we should resolve first?"
- "Please generate the Bootstrap for our first execution session."

USER ACTION: After the rooting session:
1. Download all artifacts (Project Guide, Phase Protocol, Bootstrap)
2. Store Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge
3. Upload transcript to project notebook (if using notebook connectivity)
4. Verify Bootstrap includes Phase Protocol review instruction
5. Update your new chat notepad with the next session name and
   notebook references
