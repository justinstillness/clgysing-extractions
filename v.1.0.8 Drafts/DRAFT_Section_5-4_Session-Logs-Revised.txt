5.4 SESSION LOGS
-----------------

5.4.1 Definition
-----------------

Session Logs record what occurred in each AI chat session: objectives,
work accomplished, decisions made, issues encountered, outputs produced,
response indexes used, and a structured fidelity assessment of the
session's quality and handoff readiness.


5.4.2 Purpose
--------------

Session Logs serve five purposes:

Progress Tracking. Across a multi-session project, logs show what was
accomplished when and whether objectives were met, partially met, or
deferred. The Scope Observations section captures planned-vs-actual
divergences that inform future session planning.

Issue Documentation. Problems encountered and how they were resolved (or
deferred) are captured for future reference. Recurring issues across
multiple session logs signal systemic problems that may warrant process
changes.

Output Registry. Files produced in each session are listed with file
class annotations, preventing loss and enabling retrieval. The file
class system (LOG, DRAFT, SPEC, REF, PLAN, BOOTSTRAP, FINDINGS,
TEMPLATE, DELIVERABLE) provides at-a-glance classification of session
outputs.

Retrieval Index. The Response Index Register maps every substantive AI
response to a sequential index number and semantic title. This creates
a structured lookup table: the log tells you which response index to
look for, and the chat transcript contains the full content at that
index. This is significantly faster than searching unindexed transcripts.

Continuity Verification. The embedded Session Fidelity Report (SFR)
provides a structured assessment of session quality, phase progress,
identified gaps, and handoff readiness. This goes beyond recording what
happened to evaluating how well it went and what the next session needs
to know.


5.4.3 Entry Structure
----------------------

Each Session Log includes the following sections:

Header:
- File Class (LOG)
- Project name and description
- Session identifier (matching chat name)
- Date (or date range for extended sessions)
- Session type (Phase name and activity type)

Session Objective:
- Primary and secondary objectives as stated at session start
- Specific enough that achievement can be assessed

Work Accomplished:
- Numbered list of major activities and outputs
- Objective achievement assessment (FULL / PARTIAL / MINIMAL)

Decisions Made:
- Table of decisions with IDs and brief descriptions
- Reference to Decision Log for full rationale

Scope Observations:
- Planned vs. actual comparison
- Emergent items (unplanned work, insights, concerns)
- Scope expansions flagged (with decision references)

Phase Progress:
- Current phase status with completion criteria tracking
- Checkmark status for each criterion ([✓] / [~] / [ ])
- Estimated phase completion percentage

Issues Encountered:
- Table with status (Resolved / Open / Deferred / Noted)
- Resolution notes or forward references

Files Produced:
- Table with file class annotation
- Total artifact count

Response Index Register:
- Table mapping each response index to its semantic title
- Session index range (start through end)
- Next session start index
- Compaction event notes (if applicable)

Session Fidelity Report (embedded):
- See Section 5.4.4 for SFR structure

Bootstrap Status:
- Whether generated, filename, target session, suggested next name

Template TPL-005 (Session Log) provides the complete format.


5.4.4 Session Fidelity Report (SFR)
-------------------------------------

The Session Fidelity Report is a structured assessment embedded in every
Session Log. It is generated as part of the closeout sequence and
provides a comprehensive evaluation that goes beyond "what happened" to
address "how well did it go and what does the next session need."

The SFR serves three purposes:

Quality Verification. Honest assessment of whether objectives were met
and to what degree. The SFR should report accurately, not optimistically
— if objectives were only partially met, it says so. If performance
degraded due to context exhaustion, it documents the degradation.

Continuity Assurance. Explicit handoff context that the Bootstrap draws
from. The Handoff Status section identifies what context must persist,
what materials the next session needs, and what risks or warnings apply.

Pattern Detection. Over multiple sessions, SFR entries reveal patterns
in scope management, estimation accuracy, and recurring gaps. A project
that consistently shows PARTIAL objective achievement may have a scoping
problem. A project with recurring gaps in the same category has a
systematic blind spot.

SFR Structure:
- Status: DRAFT (pending user verification) or CONFIRMED
- Phase and date
- Work Accomplished: planned objectives vs. actual completion
- Objective Achievement: FULL / PARTIAL / MINIMAL
- Phase Progress: completion criteria with checkmarks
- Decisions Crystallized: summary of formal decisions
- Gaps & Insights: missing information, discoveries, process improvements
- Handoff Status: context carried forward, materials needed, risks
- Next Session Projection: focus, success criteria, complexity estimate
- Verification: user confirmation (PENDING / CONFIRMED)

User Verification: The SFR is generated in DRAFT status. The user may
review and confirm accuracy after the session. This verification is
encouraged but not blocking — an unverified SFR retains its value for
continuity.


5.4.5 Relationship to Chat Exports
-------------------------------------

Session Logs are not chat transcripts. The full transcript (exported via
Claude Exporter or equivalent) provides the complete verbatim record;
the Session Log provides the structured summary. Both are valuable:

Transcript: Complete but lengthy; useful for detailed reconstruction,
retrieval of specific exchanges, and notebook upload for context recovery.

Session Log: Condensed, structured, and assessable; useful for quick
orientation, progress tracking, and pattern analysis across sessions.

Standard practice: maintain both. Export transcripts for archive and
notebook upload; maintain Session Logs for active reference and project
governance.

The Response Index Register bridges both artifacts: the register in the
Session Log identifies what to look for, and the transcript contains the
indexed content. Together, they provide both structured navigation and
complete detail.


5.4.6 File Structure
---------------------

Session Logs are maintained as individual files per session:

File naming: [###]_session-log.txt
Example: 034_session-log.txt

For sessions with distinctive scope, a descriptive suffix may be added:
Example: 013_session-log_(StressTest-SignalStrings).txt

Individual files per session (rather than a single append-only file) are
recommended because:
- Each file can be uploaded to notebooks independently
- Individual files are easier to reference from Bootstraps
- File size remains manageable for long-running projects
- Session identification is immediate from the filename

For projects using notebook connectivity, individual session logs should
be uploaded to the project notebook after each session to support context
recovery through querying.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
This content replaces the current Section 5.3 (lines 2836-2905) and is
renumbered as Section 5.4 per the Drafting Plan structural changes.

STRUCTURAL CHANGES:
- 5.4.1 Definition: Expanded to mention response indexing and SFR
- 5.4.2 Purpose: Expanded from 4 purposes to 5 (added Retrieval Index)
- 5.4.3 Entry Structure: Substantially expanded to reflect all sections
  in the revised TPL-005
- 5.4.4 Session Fidelity Report: NEW subsection — full SFR specification
- 5.4.5 Relationship to Chat Exports: Revised to reference Response
  Index bridging function
- 5.4.6 File Structure: NEW subsection — individual file per session
  recommendation (replacing the v1.0 append-only guidance)

CROSS-REFERENCES TO UPDATE IN SESSION G:
- Section 4.3.3 (Session Closeout) references Session Log with embedded
  SFR — this section provides the specification
- Section 4.3.1.2 (Response Indexing System) references the Response
  Index Register — this section confirms its home in the Session Log
- Section 12.1 (Multi-Session Continuity) should reference the SFR as
  a continuity verification tool
- Glossary entries needed: Session Fidelity Report, Response Index
  Register

CONSISTENCY WITH SESSION B DRAFTS:
- TPL-005 (Session Log template) mirrors this narrative section's
  structure — the template is the implementation of what this section
  describes
- Section 4.3 (Session Lifecycle) references the Session Log and SFR
  in the closeout protocol — this section provides the detailed
  specification
