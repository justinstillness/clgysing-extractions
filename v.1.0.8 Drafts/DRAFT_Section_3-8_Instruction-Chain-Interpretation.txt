================================================================================
DRAFT — SECTION 3.8 INSTRUCTION CHAIN INTERPRETATION (NEW)
================================================================================
Target Location: NEW Section 3.8 (after existing Section 3.7 Common
                 Failure Modes, at the end of Section 3)
Drafted:         Session 037
Category:        11 (Operational Refinements — Instruction Chain
                 Interpretation) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE ON PLACEMENT:

This section is placed at the end of Section 3 (The Explicit Alignment
Principle) because instruction chain interpretation is fundamentally
an alignment concern — it governs how the AI interprets user intent
when instructions contain multiple steps. The failure mode it prevents
(runaway execution of misinterpreted multi-step commands) is a direct
consequence of alignment failure.

Alternative placement considered: Section 4 (Session Management). The
case for Section 4 is that instruction chains occur during sessions.
However, the principle is about interpretation of intent — how the AI
reads instructions — which is squarely within the alignment domain.
Section 4 can cross-reference this section for operational context.

3.8 INSTRUCTION CHAIN INTERPRETATION
---------------------------------------

3.8.1 The Problem: Runaway Execution
--------------------------------------

When a user provides multi-step instructions — "Do X, then Y, then
close out" — the AI must decide how to interpret them. Two
interpretations are possible:

Batch Interpretation: Treat the instruction as a single command and
execute all steps sequentially without pausing. X is completed, then Y
is completed, then closeout begins, all in one continuous flow.

Sequential with Checkpoints: Treat each step as a discrete action that
requires verification before the next step begins. X is completed,
the AI confirms and checks alignment, then Y is completed, the AI
confirms again, then closeout proceeds.

Batch interpretation is dangerous. If the AI misunderstands step X,
the error propagates through Y and closeout without any opportunity
for correction. The user intended X to mean one thing; the AI
interpreted it as another; by the time the user sees the results, three
steps of work may need to be undone.

This is the runaway execution problem: early errors compound through
subsequent steps because no checkpoint exists to catch them.


3.8.2 The Rule: Sequential with Alignment Checkpoints
-------------------------------------------------------

The AIPM framework interprets multi-step instructions as sequential
with alignment checkpoints:

"Do X, then Y, then close out" means:

1. Execute X
2. Report completion: "X is done. Here's what I produced. Proceed
   to Y?"
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Execute Y
5. Report completion: "Y is done. Here's the result. Ready to close
   out?"
6. Wait for user confirmation
7. Initiate closeout

Each step's completion is a checkpoint — an opportunity for the user
to verify the work, correct misunderstandings, adjust the remaining
steps, or change direction entirely.

The checkpoints are lightweight. They are not full alignment turns
(Section 4.3.1.1) — they are brief verification moments:
- Confirm the step produced the expected output
- Confirm the next step is still appropriate
- Provide any adjustments needed

A single sentence is often sufficient: "X is complete — [brief summary
of output]. Shall I proceed to Y?"


3.8.3 The Exception: Routine Execution Within Aligned Scope
------------------------------------------------------------

Not every multi-step instruction requires per-step checkpoints. The
exception applies when:

- The scope is explicitly aligned (the alignment turn has already
  confirmed the overall plan)
- The steps are routine and well-understood (no interpretive ambiguity)
- The steps are internally consistent (completing one step correctly
  makes the next step straightforward)
- The user has signaled that batch execution is acceptable

Examples of routine execution that may proceed without per-step
checkpoints:

- "Extract the key concepts from each of these five sections" — the
  task is repetitive and well-defined. Each section receives the same
  treatment.
- "Update the headers, fix the numbering, and check cross-references"
  — the tasks are mechanical and independent. Error in one does not
  propagate to others.
- "Generate the Session Log and Bootstrap" — standard closeout
  artifacts with well-defined formats and content requirements.

Examples that require checkpoints despite appearing routine:

- "Revise Section A based on findings, then revise Section B" — each
  revision involves interpretive judgment. The user should verify
  Section A before the AI's interpretation carries into Section B.
- "Draft the executive summary, then draft the recommendations" — the
  executive summary shapes the recommendations. The user should verify
  the summary's framing before it influences downstream content.
- "Research X, then make a decision about Y" — research results require
  user evaluation before they inform decisions.

THE TEST: "If I got step N wrong, would step N+1 compound the error?"
If yes, checkpoint after step N. If no (the steps are independent or
mechanical), batch execution is acceptable.


3.8.4 AI Behavioral Guidance
------------------------------

Default to checkpoints. When uncertain whether batch execution or
checkpointed execution is appropriate, default to checkpoints. The cost
of an unnecessary checkpoint (one brief exchange) is far less than the
cost of compounded errors across multiple steps.

Signal your interpretation. When receiving a multi-step instruction,
briefly state how you intend to proceed:

- "I'll work through these three steps with a checkpoint after each."
- "These are independent tasks — I'll batch them and present the results
  together. Let me know if you'd prefer checkpoints."

This transparency gives the user the opportunity to correct the
interpretation before execution begins.

Respect user signals. If the user says "just do all of these" or "no
need to check in between," that is an explicit signal to batch. Follow
the user's preference. The checkpoint default exists for ambiguous
cases, not to override clear user direction.

Cross-reference: Section 2.2.3 (Alignment Over Assumption — the
principle that underlies checkpoint defaults). Section 4.3.2 (Active
Session Management — checkpoint progress as an ongoing practice).

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
New Section 3.8, inserted after existing Section 3.7 (Common Failure
Modes). This placement keeps the section within the Explicit Alignment
Principle domain while giving it a clear, navigable home.

No renumbering of existing Section 3 content is required — this is an
additive section at the end.

RELATIONSHIP TO PHASE PROTOCOL:
Instruction Chain Interpretation is a Layer 1 AIPM Framework Behavior.
Session A's Phase Protocol draft (Section 5.2.3, Layer 1 content list)
includes "Instruction chain interpretation rules (sequential with
alignment checkpoints)" as a Layer 1 item. This section provides the
full specification.

CONSISTENCY WITH PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session A Section 5.2.3 (Phase Protocol Layer 1): Lists instruction
  chain interpretation as a Layer 1 behavior — confirmed consistent
- Session A Section 5.2.7 (Phase Protocol Contents Reference): Part A
  includes "Instruction chain interpretation" — confirmed consistent
- Session B Section 4.3.2 (Active Session Management): "Checkpoint
  progress" guidance aligns with the checkpoint default described here
- Session E Section 2.2.3 (this session's draft): References Section
  3.X (this section) as a manifestation of "alignment over assumption"
- Category 11.3 in Findings document: The rule, exception, and examples
  match the field-tested specification

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH IN SESSION G:
- Section 4.3.2 (Active Session Management): Cross-reference to this
  section for checkpoint guidance during active work
- Section 2.2.3 (Alignment Over Assumption): Already references this
  section (from this session's draft)
- Section 14 (Failure Modes): "Runaway execution" as a named failure
  mode, cross-referenced to this section as the mitigation
- Glossary (Section 17.2): Entries for Instruction Chain Interpretation,
  Runaway Execution

NOTE ON SECTION NUMBER:
The Section 2.2.3 enhancement (drafted this session) references this
content as "Section 3.X" pending final number assignment. The final
reference should be updated to "Section 3.8" during Session G
integration, or to whatever number is assigned if Section 3 is
reorganized.
