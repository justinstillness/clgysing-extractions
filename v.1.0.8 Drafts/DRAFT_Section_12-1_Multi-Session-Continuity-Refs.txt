DRAFT — SECTION 12.1 MULTI-SESSION CONTINUITY (ADD REFERENCES)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 12.1 (ADDITIONS to existing content)
Current Lines:   4783-4848 in v1.0.7
Drafted:         Session 034
Category:        3 (Enhanced Session Lifecycle) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE: This is a lightweight cross-reference addition, not a full
rewrite. The existing Section 12.1 content is well-written and adequate.
These additions integrate the new Session B concepts into the continuity
framework.

ADDITION 1: New continuity mechanism — INSERT after "Chat Transcript
Archives" block (after approximately line 4831) and before "Continuity
Anti-Patterns"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT:

Response Indexing System (Section 4.3.1.2)

The Response Indexing System provides a persistent, project-wide
numbering scheme for significant AI responses. Each substantive output
receives a sequential index — [0001], [0002], and so on — that continues
across all sessions without resetting at phase or session boundaries.

The index enables precise retrieval from transcripts. Each Session Log
includes a Response Index Register mapping indexes to semantic titles.
When a future session needs to reference specific prior work, the
register identifies the exact response index to locate in the
transcript. This transforms the transcript archive from a verbose,
unsearchable record into a precisely navigable resource.

Response indexing also supports notebook-based context recovery. When
session logs are uploaded to a project notebook, the indexes provide
structured reference points that notebook queries can target.

Continuity is maintained through the Bootstrap, which specifies the
last index used and the next session's starting index. If the sequence
breaks, the AI requests recovery guidance from the user.

Session Fidelity Reports (Section 5.4.4)

The Session Fidelity Report (SFR), embedded in every Session Log,
provides structured assessment of session quality and handoff readiness.
Beyond recording what happened, the SFR evaluates objective achievement,
identifies gaps and insights, and projects the next session's focus and
complexity.

For continuity, the SFR's Handoff Status section is critical: it
explicitly identifies context that must persist, materials the next
session requires, and risks or warnings that could affect resumption.
This structured handoff assessment prevents the subtle context losses
that accumulate when bootstraps carry forward "what" without assessing
"how well" and "what's at risk."

Over multiple sessions, the pattern of SFR entries reveals continuity
health — consistent FULL objective achievement suggests stable
continuity; recurring PARTIAL achievements may indicate that continuity
mechanisms are losing information at session boundaries.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 2: Update the introductory paragraph to reference five
mechanisms instead of three — REPLACE lines 4786-4791
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE:

Multi-session continuity is the central challenge of extended AI work.
Each new session begins with no memory of prior sessions. Without
deliberate continuity mechanisms, every session restart imposes a
reconstruction cost that compounds over time.

The framework addresses this through five interconnected mechanisms:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 3: Additional anti-pattern — INSERT after existing anti-
patterns (after approximately line 4846)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT:

Unindexed sessions. Sessions that do not maintain response indexing lose
the structured retrieval capability that makes transcript archives
useful. Without indexes, recovering specific prior work from transcripts
requires linear searching through potentially thousands of exchanges.
Maintain the index from the first session — the incremental cost is
negligible and the retrieval value compounds over time.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
- Addition 1: Insert the two new mechanism descriptions after "Chat
  Transcript Archives" and before "Continuity Anti-Patterns"
- Addition 2: Replace the introductory count ("three" → "five")
- Addition 3: Append after existing anti-patterns

These changes are additive — no existing content is removed or modified
except the mechanism count in the introduction.

The five mechanisms in the revised section:
1. Bootstrap Documents (existing)
2. Decision Logs (existing)
3. Chat Transcript Archives (existing)
4. Response Indexing System (new)
5. Session Fidelity Reports (new)
