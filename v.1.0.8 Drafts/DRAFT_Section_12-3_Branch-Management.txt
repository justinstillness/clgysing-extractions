DRAFT — SECTION 12.3 BRANCH MANAGEMENT (NEW)
================================================================================
Target Location: NEW Section 12.3 (after Section 12.2 Complex Project
                 Management)
Drafted:         Session 036
Category:        6 (Branch Management) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

RATIONALE:

The v1.0.7 manual introduces Branch Chats in Section 4.1.1 as a chat
type but provides no management system for branching — no creation
process, no startup protocol, no cross-branch coordination, no guidance
on when branching is appropriate. Field testing across multiple projects
(CLGYSING, AWSNBLM, NLMINTA) revealed that branching is a substantial
operational capability requiring its own governance framework.

Placement in Section 12 (Extended Context) rather than Section 4
(Session Management) is deliberate: branching is a multi-session,
multi-workstream concept that extends beyond individual session
management. It layers naturally on Section 12.1 (Multi-Session
Continuity) and 12.2 (Complex Project Management). Section 4.1 retains
the chat-level description of Branch Chats; Section 12.3 provides the
management system that governs how branches are created, operated, and
coordinated.

12.3 BRANCH MANAGEMENT
-----------------------

12.3.1 Branching Concept
--------------------------

Branching is the formal mechanism for managing parallel workstreams
under a single project umbrella. When a project's work naturally
divides into streams that benefit from isolation — separate context
windows, independent session sequences, focused scope — branching
provides the governance structure to manage that division without
losing coherence.

A branch is a fractal expression of the project structure. It inherits
the DNA of the parent project — behavioral governance, naming
conventions, artifact standards — but adapts scope for its specific
objectives. The rooting principles that establish a project's foundation
(Section 2.5.1) apply at the branch level in abbreviated form: every
branch establishes its own foundation before execution begins.

Branching creates managed autonomy. Each branch operates with
independence sufficient to maintain focus, while coordination mechanisms
prevent branches from diverging into incompatible directions. The
balance between autonomy and coordination is the central challenge of
branch management.


12.3.2 When to Branch
-----------------------

Branching is appropriate when a workstream meets one or more of these
criteria:

CONTEXT ISOLATION NEEDED: The workstream generates substantial context
(research findings, technical specifications, test results) that would
dilute the mainline project's context window. Branching gives the
workstream its own context space without compromising mainline focus.

PARALLEL EXECUTION POSSIBLE: The workstream can proceed independently
of the mainline for a meaningful duration. If the workstream requires
constant mainline coordination, it may be better served as a phase
within the mainline rather than a separate branch.

DISTINCT LIFECYCLE: The workstream has its own natural phases — setup,
execution, completion — that do not map cleanly onto the mainline's
phase structure. Branches accommodate workstreams that move at different
cadences than the main project.

DEPENDENCY DEVELOPMENT: Work needed before the mainline can proceed,
but that benefits from focused attention in its own context. A branch
can develop a dependency (a specification, a tool evaluation, a
reference document) while the mainline continues other work.

EXPLORATORY RISK: The workstream involves exploratory or speculative
work where outcomes are uncertain. Branching contains the exploration's
context footprint — if the exploration proves unfruitful, the mainline
is unaffected.

WHEN NOT TO BRANCH:

Not every parallel need warrants a branch. Consider alternatives:

- EXECUTION CHATS: For narrowly scoped, one-off tasks (drafting a
  single document, formatting a deliverable), an Execution Chat
  (Section 4.1.1) is lighter weight than a branch. Execution Chats
  are disposable once outputs are saved.

- PHASE DIVISION: If the workstream is sequential with the mainline
  (one must complete before the other begins), it is better modeled
  as a phase within the mainline than a parallel branch.

- WITHIN-SESSION SCOPE: If the work can be completed within the current
  session's headroom, branching introduces unnecessary overhead. Capture
  it as part of the current session's work.

The decision to branch should be explicit and documented. If the user
is uncertain, the AI can help evaluate using the criteria above.


12.3.3 Branch Creation Process
--------------------------------

Branch creation follows a five-step process that ensures the new
workstream is properly scoped and connected to the mainline:

STEP 1 — DECISION. The user decides to create a branch, either during
a mainline session or a dedicated planning session. The decision should
be captured in the Decision Log (D-###) with rationale for why
branching is appropriate.

STEP 2 — STARTUP FILE GENERATION. The mainline session generates a
Branch Startup File (TPL-0XX) containing the context the new branch
needs to begin work. The Startup File is a specialized derivative of
the Bootstrap (TPL-002), adapted for branch initialization rather than
session continuation.

The Startup File includes:
- Branch identification (name, handle, parent project reference)
- Inherited Phase Protocol reference (which Phase Protocol governs
  this branch, and whether modifications are needed)
- Relevant mainline decisions and context that the branch needs
- Branch scope boundaries (what is in scope, what is not)
- Expected deliverables and integration points back to mainline
- Notebook connectivity references (main project notebook and any
  branch-specific adjunct)
- Mini-rooting questions to be addressed at branch start

STEP 3 — HANDOFF. The user takes the Startup File to the new branch
chat. This is a user action — the user creates a new chat, uploads the
Startup File (and this manual if the branch AI needs AIPM orientation),
and initiates the branch.

STEP 4 — MINI-ROOTING. The new branch conducts an abbreviated rooting
cycle to establish branch-specific context. Mini-rooting addresses:

- What is this branch trying to accomplish? (Scope confirmation)
- How does it connect to the mainline project? (Dependency mapping)
- Do we need to modify the inherited Phase Protocol? (Behavioral
  calibration — the branch may need different AI behaviors than the
  mainline)
- Is this a single-phase or multi-phase branch? (Structure planning)
- What templates and conventions apply? (Standard confirmation)

Mini-rooting is typically a focused exchange of 3-8 questions, not the
extensive 10-20 exchange rooting process used for new projects. The
Startup File provides sufficient context that the branch can orient
quickly.

STEP 5 — EXECUTION. The branch begins execution with its own session
numbering, producing its own artifacts and maintaining its own session
logs and bootstraps. The branch operates with managed autonomy under
its Phase Protocol.


12.3.4 Branch Operational Characteristics
-------------------------------------------

Each branch maintains operational independence while remaining connected
to the parent project:

INDEPENDENT SESSION NUMBERING: Branches maintain their own session
number sequence, separate from the mainline. This prevents confusion
when multiple workstreams are active simultaneously. Branch sessions
use the branch handle in their naming convention (see Section 12.3.5).

INHERITED PHASE PROTOCOL: Branches inherit the parent project's Phase
Protocol but may modify it for branch-specific needs. The branch does
not start from zero regarding behavioral governance — it inherits the
framework's behavioral standards, the project's methodology, and any
project-specific conventions. Modifications should be documented in the
branch's first session log.

If the branch's Phase Protocol modifications are substantial, a
branch-specific Phase Protocol document should be created and stored
in the branch's Project Knowledge. For minor modifications, a note in
the Startup File and first session log is sufficient.

BRANCH-SPECIFIC NOTEBOOKS: Branches typically use their own adjunct
notebook (Section 10.3.4) to avoid diluting the main project notebook
with branch-specific exploration. The branch adjunct contains branch
transcripts, branch-specific artifacts, and branch research materials.

Both the main project notebook and the branch adjunct should be
accessible to branch sessions via notebook connectivity, allowing the
branch to query mainline context when needed. The Bootstrap specifies
which notebooks to consult and for what purpose.

Naming convention for branch notebooks:
[PROJECT-HANDLE] [Branch Name] Sessions

OWN ARTIFACTS: Branches generate their own bootstraps, session logs,
decision logs, and findings reports. These artifacts follow the same
templates and conventions as mainline artifacts. Branch artifacts should
be uploaded to the branch adjunct notebook and, selectively, to the
main project notebook when they contain information relevant to the
broader project.

RESPONSE INDEX: Branches may maintain their own response index sequence
(starting at [0001]) or continue the mainline sequence, depending on
whether the branch will eventually integrate its transcripts with the
mainline corpus. If maintaining a separate sequence, document this in
the Startup File.


12.3.5 Branch Naming Conventions
----------------------------------

Branch naming follows the project's established naming convention
(Section 4.1.3) with the BR type indicator:

FORMAT: [###] [DEPT]-[PROJ]-BR ([branch purpose])

Examples:
- 001 GOV-AIPM-BR (security research)
- 002 GOV-AIPM-BR (tooling integration)
- 003 PRO-CLGY-BR (dependency development)

The sequence number is the branch's own session count, not the
mainline's. Branch session 003 is the third session of that branch,
regardless of where the mainline's session count stands.

BRANCH HANDLES:

For projects with multiple active branches, short handles improve
readability in cross-references and coordination documents:

Examples:
- SECRES (security research branch)
- TOOLINT (tooling integration branch)
- DEPDEV (dependency development branch)

Handles appear in the Cross-Branch Awareness Document (Section 12.3.7)
and may be used in decision logs and session logs when referencing
branch-specific work.


12.3.6 Cross-Branch Context Sharing
--------------------------------------

Branches operating in parallel create a coordination challenge: each
branch accumulates context independently, potentially developing
approaches or making discoveries that affect other branches or the
mainline. Without deliberate sharing mechanisms, branches become
context silos.

SHARING MECHANISMS:

Shared Main Notebook: All branches maintain access to the main project
notebook. When a branch produces findings, decisions, or deliverables
relevant to the broader project, these artifacts should be uploaded to
the main notebook in addition to the branch adjunct. This ensures that
any session — mainline or branch — can query the main notebook for
cross-project context.

Selective Artifact Upload: Not every branch artifact belongs in the
main notebook. Branch-specific exploration, draft iterations, and
working notes stay in the branch adjunct. Artifacts that cross the
upload threshold include: finalized deliverables, findings that inform
mainline decisions, specifications that other branches need to
reference, and decisions that affect the project-wide scope.

Bootstrap Cross-References: When a mainline session's Bootstrap is
written, it should note any active branches and their current status.
This provides mainline sessions with awareness of parallel work without
requiring full branch context loading.

Integration Sessions: Periodically, branches rejoin the mainline
through integration sessions. These sessions consolidate branch
outputs, reconcile any divergences, and update the mainline's artifacts
with branch contributions. Integration sessions are a natural
checkpoint for Cross-Branch Awareness Document updates.


12.3.7 Cross-Branch Awareness Document
-----------------------------------------

For projects with multiple active branches, the Cross-Branch Awareness
Document provides a shared reference that any session — mainline or
branch — can consult for an overview of the project's parallel work.

PURPOSE:

The document ensures that every session has awareness of what other
branches are doing without requiring full context on each branch. It
prevents the common failure mode where branches develop incompatible
approaches because neither was aware of the other's direction.

CONTENT:

The Cross-Branch Awareness Document contains:

ACTIVE BRANCHES REGISTER:
| Branch Handle | Full Name              | Objective                    | Status    |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| [HANDLE]      | [Branch full name]     | [What branch is working on]  | [Active/  |
|               |                        |                              |  Paused/  |
|               |                        |                              |  Complete]|

BRANCH OBJECTIVES: For each active branch, a 2-3 sentence summary of
its current objective, expected deliverables, and estimated timeline.

INTER-BRANCH DEPENDENCIES: Any dependencies between branches — where
one branch's output is needed by another, or where branches must
coordinate approaches to avoid incompatibility.

COORDINATION NEEDS: Specific items requiring cross-branch attention.
Examples: "SECRES branch evaluating encryption approach — TOOLINT
branch should not commit to a TLS implementation until SECRES
concludes."

RECENT UPDATES: A brief log of significant branch events since the
last update — completions, major findings, scope changes, integration
milestones.

PLACEMENT:

The Cross-Branch Awareness Document is stored in Project Knowledge
alongside the Phase Protocol, making it accessible to every session
without explicit upload. It is updated at natural checkpoints:
- When a new branch is created
- When a branch completes or pauses
- At integration sessions
- When inter-branch dependencies change
- Periodically during long-running parallel work

Template TPL-0XX (Cross-Branch Awareness Document) provides the
standard structure.


12.3.8 Branch Integration and Completion
------------------------------------------

Branches complete their work and rejoin the mainline through a
structured integration process:

INTEGRATION SESSION: A mainline session (or dedicated integration
session) reviews branch outputs, assesses quality, and incorporates
deliverables into the mainline project. The integration session should:

- Review all branch deliverables against the original scope defined in
  the Startup File
- Identify any deviations from the original scope and assess whether
  they are improvements or drift
- Reconcile any branch decisions that affect the mainline (update
  Decision Log if needed)
- Update the mainline's artifacts with branch contributions
- Update the Cross-Branch Awareness Document to reflect completion
- Archive the branch's artifacts in the project folder structure

BRANCH CLOSURE: After integration, the branch is marked complete in
the Cross-Branch Awareness Document. Branch artifacts are preserved in
the project's archive structure (Section 6.2.3) for future reference.

INCOMPLETE BRANCHES: If a branch is abandoned or indefinitely paused,
document the reason in the Cross-Branch Awareness Document and ensure
any partial work is preserved. Incomplete branches may contain valuable
findings or partial deliverables that inform future work.


12.3.9 Anti-Patterns
----------------------

Common branching failures to avoid:

ORPHANED BRANCHES: Branches created but never integrated back into the
mainline. The branch produces work that languishes in isolation because
no integration session was planned. Prevention: define integration
expectations in the Startup File and track branch status in the
Cross-Branch Awareness Document.

CONTEXT SILOS: Branches that accumulate significant knowledge but never
share it with the main notebook or other branches. A branch discovers
something important, but the discovery stays in the branch adjunct
where no other session can find it. Prevention: upload cross-relevant
artifacts to the main notebook; maintain the Cross-Branch Awareness
Document with recent updates.

PREMATURE BRANCHING: Creating branches for work that would be better
handled as execution chats or phases within the mainline. Branching
introduces coordination overhead; if the work does not meet the
criteria in Section 12.3.2, a simpler structure is preferable.
Prevention: evaluate against the branching criteria before creating.

BRANCH PROLIFERATION: Creating too many parallel branches, exceeding
the project's coordination capacity. Each active branch requires
maintenance (session logs, bootstraps, notebook uploads, awareness
document updates). Prevention: limit active branches to what the user
can practically maintain; complete or pause branches before starting
new ones.

PHASE PROTOCOL DRIFT: A branch modifies its inherited Phase Protocol
so extensively that it effectively operates under different governance
than the mainline. When integration occurs, the behavioral gap creates
reconciliation problems. Prevention: document Phase Protocol
modifications explicitly; keep modifications minimal unless the branch
genuinely requires different behavioral governance.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
New Section 12.3, inserted after Section 12.2 (Complex Project
Management). The current v1.0.7 does not have a Section 12.3.

RELATIONSHIP TO SECTION 4.1:
Section 4.1.1 (Chat Types) defines Branch Chats at the chat level —
what they are and when they are used. Section 12.3 provides the
management system — how branches are created, operated, coordinated,
and completed. The two sections are complementary:
- Section 4.1.1 tells you WHAT a branch chat is
- Section 12.3 tells you HOW to manage branching as a system

An integration point (drafted this session) enhances Section 4.1.1
with a cross-reference to 12.3.

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH IN SESSION G:
- Section 4.1.1 (Branch Chats): Add cross-reference to 12.3 for
  formal branch management protocol
- Section 4.3.1 (Session Initiation): Already includes "For Branch
  Sessions" sequence referencing mini-rooting and Branch Startup File
  — verify consistency with 12.3.3 and 12.3.4
- Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol): Reference branch inheritance and
  modification patterns
- Section 5.8 (Artifact Relationships): Add Branch Startup File to
  relationship map (integration point drafted this session)
- Section 6.2.4 (Notebook Organization): Already references branch
  adjunct notebooks — verify consistency with 12.3.4
- Section 10.3.4 (Notebook Organization Strategy): Already references
  branch-specific notebooks — verify consistency
- Section 12.1 (Continuity): Branch continuity mechanisms are a
  specialized application of the six mechanisms described in 12.1

CONSISTENCY WITH PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session A Integration Point 1 (Section 4.3.1): Includes "For Branch
  Sessions" initiation sequence with mini-rooting — CONSISTENT with
  12.3.3 Step 4
- Session B TPL-002 v2.0: Mentions branch bootstraps as a bootstrap
  type — CONSISTENT; the Branch Startup File (TPL-0XX) is the
  branch-specific derivative
- Session B Section 4.3.1: "For Branch Sessions" references Branch
  Startup File and mini-rooting cycle — CONSISTENT with 12.3.3
- Session C Section 10.3.4: References branch-specific adjunct
  notebooks with naming convention — CONSISTENT with 12.3.4
- Session C Section 6.2.4: References branch notebooks — CONSISTENT
