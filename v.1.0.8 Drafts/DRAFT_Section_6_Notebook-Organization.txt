DRAFT — SECTION 6 EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION SYSTEM (NOTEBOOK ENHANCEMENT)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 6 (ADDITIONS to existing content)
Drafted:         Session 035
Category:        4 (NotebookLM / Notebook Integration) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE: These are targeted additions to Section 6. The existing Section 6
content (naming conventions, folder structure, duplication discipline,
cloud storage, retrieval patterns, organization hygiene) is well-
structured and adequate. These additions integrate notebook organization
into the existing framework.

================================================================================
BEGIN DRAFT CONTENT
================================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 1: Section 6.2 Folder Structure — ADD new subsection after
6.2.3 Archive Structure (after approximately line 3493)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT as new subsection 6.2.4:

6.2.4 Notebook Organization
----------------------------

For projects using notebook connectivity (Section 10.3), the notebook
ecosystem is an extension of the project's organizational structure.
Notebooks require the same intentional organization as folders and files.

NAMING CONVENTION:

Notebook names follow the project's naming conventions:

  [PROJECT-HANDLE] [Purpose]

Examples:
- GOV-AIPM Review Material (main project notebook)
- AWSNBLM Session Transcripts (branch-specific adjunct)
- NLMINTA Research Sources (research adjunct)

The project handle prefix enables quick identification across a user's
full notebook inventory.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:

One main notebook per project. This is the central repository that all
sessions and branches can access. It contains the cumulative project
corpus: transcripts, artifacts, specifications, findings, and
deliverables.

Adjunct notebooks as warranted. Create dedicated notebooks for:
- Branches that generate substantial independent context
- External research or reference corpora
- Specialized test or validation environments

NOTEBOOK DIRECTORY:

Maintain a notebook directory (Section 10.3.6) as part of the project's
reference materials. This directory maps all project notebooks to their
IDs, contents, and query purposes. Store the directory in the project's
Guides or Reference folder and embed it in the Bootstrap template.

RELATIONSHIP TO FOLDER STRUCTURE:

Notebooks and folders serve complementary purposes:
- Folders preserve files as discrete artifacts (browsable, versionable)
- Notebooks preserve content as queryable knowledge (searchable,
  retrievable by topic)

A well-organized project maintains both: folders for file management
and notebooks for context recovery. The same artifacts live in both
systems — the folder stores the file, the notebook indexes its content.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 2: Section 6.6 Organization Hygiene — ADD to 6.6.1 Session-
Level Hygiene (after approximately line 3642)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT (append to existing 6.6.1 content):

If using notebook connectivity:
- Upload session transcript to the project notebook
- Upload non-ephemeral artifacts (specifications, findings, deliverables)
- If using the consolidated document approach, update the master
  document and re-sync

See Section 10.3.3 for the detailed upload workflow.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITION 3: Section 6.6 Organization Hygiene — ADD to 6.6.2 Weekly
Hygiene (after approximately line 3653)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT (append to existing 6.6.2 content):

If using notebook connectivity:
- Verify notebooks are current (no sessions missing from the corpus)
- Review notebook source count against plan limits
- Update the notebook directory if notebooks were added or reorganized


================================================================================
INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
- Addition 1: New subsection 6.2.4 after Archive Structure
- Addition 2: Append to 6.6.1 Session-Level Hygiene
- Addition 3: Append to 6.6.2 Weekly Hygiene

These additions are lightweight — the substantive notebook content lives
in Section 10.3. Section 6 provides the organizational framework that
notebooks fit within.

CROSS-REFERENCES:
- 6.2.4 references Section 10.3 (full notebook connectivity guidance)
  and Section 10.3.6 (notebook directory)
- 6.6.1 references Section 10.3.3 (upload workflow)
- All additions use the same naming convention patterns established in
  6.1 (project handle prefix)

CONSISTENCY:
- Aligns with Section 10.3.4 (Notebook Organization Strategy) which
  covers the same concepts from the tools perspective
- Aligns with TPL-003 v2.0 Part B (User Responsibilities) which
  includes notebook sync
- Aligns with Section 4.3.3 closeout protocol user duties
