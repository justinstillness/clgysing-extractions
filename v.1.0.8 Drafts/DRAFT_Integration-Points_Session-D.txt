DRAFT — INTEGRATION POINTS FOR SESSION D CONTENT
================================================================================
Target:     Multiple existing sections in GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT
Drafted:    Session 036
Categories: 5 (Findings Reports), 6 (Branch Management),
            9 (Insight Capture) — integration weave
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

These are targeted insertions and modifications to existing manual
sections and prior drafts that create the cross-reference web connecting
Session D content to the rest of the manual.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 1: Section 5.8 Artifact Relationships
Location: Within the artifact relationship map (current 5.6 in v1.0.7,
          renumbered to 5.8 in v1.0.8)
Action: ADD Findings Reports and Branch Startup File to relationships

Note: Session A Integration Point 5 already added Phase Protocol to
this section. This integration point adds Session D artifacts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD TO ARTIFACT RELATIONSHIPS (after Phase Protocol relationships
from Session A Integration Point 5):

Findings Report Relationships:

Findings Reports connect to the artifact ecosystem as follows:

- PRODUCED DURING: Research, exploration, evaluation, and testing
  sessions
- INFORMS: Decision Logs (findings provide evidence for decisions)
- REFERENCES: Session Logs (findings cite session provenance)
- INDEXED BY: F-## identifiers (project-wide, never resets)
- TRACKED IN: Cumulative Findings Index (within reports or standalone)
- UPLOADED TO: Project notebook for queryable retrieval
- RELATED TO: Backlog Register (findings may generate backlog items
  when they reveal out-of-scope needs)

The evidence-to-decision pipeline — Findings inform Decisions — is a
core informational flow in the framework. Findings provide the
empirical foundation; Decisions record the choices that findings
support.

Branch Startup File Relationships:

Branch Startup Files connect to the artifact ecosystem as follows:

- DERIVED FROM: Bootstrap (TPL-002) — specialized for branch creation
- PRODUCED DURING: Mainline sessions when branching is decided
- REFERENCES: Phase Protocol (inherited by branch), Decision Log
  (branching decision), Cross-Branch Awareness Document (branch
  registration)
- CONSUMED BY: Branch first session (initiates mini-rooting)
- ANALOGOUS TO: Project Initiation Form (TPL-001) at the branch level
- ONE-TIME USE: After the branch's first session, subsequent sessions
  use standard Bootstraps (TPL-002)

Cross-Branch Awareness Document Relationships:

- STORED IN: Project Knowledge (accessible to all sessions)
- REFERENCES: All active Branch Startup Files
- UPDATED BY: Any session that creates, completes, or modifies a branch
- CONSUMED BY: All sessions (mainline and branch) for parallel work
  awareness
- RELATED TO: Phase Protocol (shared governance reference), Bootstrap
  (may include awareness document reminder)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 2: Section 4.1.1 Chat Types — Branch Chats
Location: Section 4.1.1, within the BRANCH CHATS description
          (approximately lines 2086-2098 in v1.0.7)
Action: ENHANCE with cross-reference to formal branch management
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD after the existing "Example uses" list for Branch Chats:

Formal Branch Management:

Section 4.1.1 describes branch chats as a chat type. Section 12.3
provides the full management system for branching — including the
branch creation process, startup files, mini-rooting cycles, naming
conventions, cross-branch coordination, and integration patterns. For
projects where branching is a deliberate strategy (rather than a
one-off chat), the branch management protocol ensures branches are
properly created, operated, and reintegrated.

Cross-reference: Section 12.3 (Branch Management).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 3: Section 4.1.2 Chat Relationships
Location: Section 4.1.2 (approximately lines 2115-2129 in v1.0.7)
Action: ADD branch management cross-reference
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD after the existing relationship list:

For projects using formal branch management (Section 12.3), the
ROOT → BRANCH and BRANCH → EXECUTION relationships are governed by the
Branch Startup File (TPL-0XX) and Cross-Branch Awareness Document
(TPL-0XX). These artifacts formalize the handoff and coordination that
the basic bootstrap mechanism handles for simpler chat relationships.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 4: Section 4.3.2 Active Session Management
Location: Within the "Maintain Focus" block of Section 4.3.2
          (Session B draft, approximately line 268-271)
Action: ENHANCE existing backlog reference with Insight Capture Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE the existing bullets:

  - Defer out-of-scope items to the Backlog Register or appropriate
    future sessions
  - Note but do not pursue tangents — capture them for later consideration

WITH:

  - When out-of-scope items surface, apply the Insight Capture Protocol
    (Section 5.9.7): pause, flag to user, and if approved, conduct the
    brief containable survey to create a structured backlog item. Do not
    silently defer or silently expand scope.
  - Note but do not pursue tangents — the Insight Capture Protocol
    provides the structured mechanism for capturing ideas without
    disrupting current work


================================================================================
INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

ORDERING:
These integration points should be applied during Session G along with
all other integration points from Sessions A-C. They are non-destructive
additions that layer onto existing content.

Integration Point 1 layers onto Session A's Integration Point 5 (which
added Phase Protocol to artifact relationships). Session G should apply
both together when revising Section 5.8.

Integration Point 4 modifies Session B's Section 4.3.2 draft content
(not the v1.0.7 original). Session G should apply the Session B
revision first, then this modification.

TEMPLATES REFERENCED:
- TPL-0XX (Findings Report) — drafted this session
- TPL-0XX (Branch Startup File) — drafted this session
- TPL-0XX (Cross-Branch Awareness Document) — drafted this session
All TPL numbers to be finalized in Session G.
