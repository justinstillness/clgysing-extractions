DRAFT — SECTION 10.3 RETRIEVAL AND QUERY TOOLS (MAJOR REVISION)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 10.3 (REPLACES existing content, lines 4488-4510)
Drafted:         Session 035
Categories:      4 (NotebookLM / Notebook Integration) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

REVISION RATIONALE:

The current Section 10.3 is five thin paragraphs covering NotebookLM
workflow integration, search tools, and reference managers. Field testing
across three project branches (CLGYSING, AWSNBLM, NLMINTA) revealed
that notebook connectivity is a foundational capability — the deep
context recovery layer that gives the AI "near-perfect fidelity capacity
between sessions." This revision expands Section 10.3 into a
comprehensive treatment with subsections, while retaining the existing
search and reference manager content.

The expansion adds: notebook connectivity as a distinct concept,
exhaustive querying technique, upload workflows, notebook organization
strategy, source efficiency for limited plans, notebook index/directory
concept, and guidance on what to upload versus skip.

Tool-agnostic framing per D-032-004: content uses "notebook connectivity
tool" as generic language with NotebookLM (and its MCP interface,
Majeston) as the reference implementation example.

10.3 RETRIEVAL AND QUERY TOOLS
-------------------------------

Context management is a persistent challenge in AI-assisted work. Every
session begins with an empty context window. Retrieval tools address
this fundamental constraint by providing access to accumulated project
knowledge without consuming the active session's token capacity.

This section covers three categories of retrieval tools: notebook
connectivity tools (the primary deep context layer), search and indexing
tools, and reference managers. Of these, notebook connectivity has
emerged from field testing as the most impactful capability for
multi-session project continuity.


10.3.1 Notebook Connectivity
------------------------------

CONCEPT:

A notebook connectivity tool is an external platform that accepts
uploaded project materials and responds to natural language queries
against them. It functions as a grounded retrieval system — answers are
derived from the uploaded corpus, not from general training data, and
typically include source attribution.

For AI-assisted project management, notebook connectivity provides the
deep context recovery layer. It complements the Bootstrap's lightweight
orientation with comprehensive access to everything that has occurred
across the project's history.

The relationship between these two systems is critical to understand:

Bootstrap: lightweight orientation tool. Tells the AI WHERE the project
left off — current state, next actions, open items, headroom notes. The
Bootstrap changes every session and carries forward only what the next
session needs to know immediately.

Notebook: deep context archive. Contains EVERYTHING that happened —
complete transcripts, all artifacts, all decisions, all research.
The notebook persists across the project and supports retrieval of any
prior context on demand.

The Bootstrap tells the AI what to look for. The notebook has the
content. Neither replaces the other — they serve complementary functions
at different depths.

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION:

NotebookLM (by Google) is the reference implementation used throughout
this manual. It accepts document uploads, supports natural language
queries with cited responses, and integrates with AI platforms through
MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools such as Majeston. Other notebook
connectivity tools that provide grounded retrieval against uploaded
corpora can be substituted.

When the AI has direct MCP access to a notebook connectivity tool, the
workflow becomes significantly more efficient. Rather than the user
manually shuttling queries and responses between the AI and the notebook
tool, the AI queries the notebook directly and narrates the results in
the conversation (see Section 4.4, Connector Transparency Protocol).

WORKFLOW INTEGRATION — TWO MODELS:

Model A — User-Mediated Retrieval (no MCP connectivity):

1. AI identifies an information need from project materials
2. AI provides the specific query for the user to execute
3. User runs the query in the notebook tool against the project corpus
4. User returns the cited response to the AI
5. AI integrates the retrieved information and proceeds

This model preserves AI context capacity for reasoning while leveraging
the notebook's retrieval capability. The cited responses provide source
attribution that would otherwise require verification.

Model B — Direct AI Retrieval (with MCP connectivity):

1. AI identifies an information need from project materials
2. AI queries the notebook tool directly via MCP
3. AI narrates the query parameters, results, and assessment in the
   conversation per the Connector Transparency Protocol (Section 4.4)
4. AI integrates the retrieved information and proceeds

Model B is faster and supports the exhaustive querying technique
(Section 10.3.2) more naturally. However, it requires adherence to the
Connector Transparency Protocol to ensure transcript completeness.

Both models share the same principle: the notebook extends effective
context beyond platform limits without consuming the active session's
token budget.


10.3.2 Exhaustive Querying Technique
--------------------------------------

When the AI needs comprehensive context on a topic — not just a single
fact but the full picture of what has been discussed, decided, and
produced — the exhaustive querying technique provides systematic
saturation.

THE TECHNIQUE:

1. QUERY. The AI queries the notebook on a specific subject. The query
   should be focused — a clear topic or question, not a vague request.

2. SUMMARIZE. The AI summarizes the information received, confirming
   its understanding of what was returned.

3. GAP QUESTION. The AI explicitly asks a follow-up: "Is there anything
   else about [topic] that I'm missing?" or "What additional context
   exists on [topic] that wasn't covered in the previous response?"

4. REPEAT. This cycle continues until the responses start returning
   similar content — saturation. At saturation, the AI has retrieved
   the substantive context available on that topic.

5. SYNTHESIZE. The AI consolidates the retrieved information into a
   working understanding and proceeds with the session's work.

WHY THIS WORKS:

Notebook connectivity tools return the most relevant results for a given
query, but a single query rarely surfaces everything. The iterative
approach exploits different angles on the same topic, pulling in context
that a single query would miss. The gap question specifically prompts
the tool to search for content not yet surfaced.

Field testing has demonstrated that exhaustive querying achieves
near-perfect fidelity between sessions — the AI reconstructs context
comparable to having been present for the prior work. This makes it
substantially more effective than loading a single summary document.

WHEN TO USE:

Exhaustive querying is warranted when:
- Beginning a session that requires deep context from prior work
- Researching a topic that spans multiple prior sessions
- Preparing to draft content that must be consistent with prior decisions
- Recovering from a context disruption (compaction event, session crash)

For simple factual lookups ("what was the last decision number?"), a
single targeted query is sufficient. Reserve the full technique for
situations where comprehensive context matters.

TOKEN TRADE-OFF:

Exhaustive querying consumes tokens — typically 3-6 query-response
cycles. However, this cost is almost always lower than uploading full
transcripts or reference documents into the context window. The
technique optimizes for information quality per token spent.


10.3.3 Upload Workflow
-----------------------

The notebook's value depends entirely on what is uploaded to it. A
notebook with stale or incomplete content provides stale or incomplete
retrieval. Maintaining the notebook is a user responsibility performed
after each session.

POST-SESSION UPLOAD PROCEDURE:

1. EXPORT. Download the chat transcript from the session using an
   export tool (Claude Exporter or equivalent). Preferred format:
   Markdown or plain text.

2. DOWNLOAD ARTIFACTS. Download all files produced during the session
   — drafts, specifications, findings reports, decision logs, session
   logs, and any other outputs.

3. ORGANIZE LOCALLY. Store all session materials in the appropriate
   session folder per the project's folder structure (see Section 6.2).

4. UPLOAD TO NOTEBOOK. Upload the following to the project notebook:
   - Chat transcript (always — this is the primary deep memory source)
   - Non-ephemeral artifacts: specifications, findings reports,
     work-in-progress documents, research outputs, deliverables

5. SYNC. If using a consolidated Google Doc approach for source
   efficiency (see Section 10.3.5), copy the new transcript into the
   master document and re-sync the source in the notebook tool.

WHAT TO UPLOAD VS. SKIP:

Upload (builds queryable deep memory):
- Chat transcripts — always. These are the primary source of project
  context and contain the full record of reasoning, decisions, and work.
- Specifications and research documents — crystallized intelligence that
  informs future sessions.
- Findings reports — synthesis documents that are highly queryable.
- Decision logs — the formal record of choices and rationale.
- Work-in-progress drafts — current state of deliverables.
- Deliverables — final outputs for reference and retrieval.

Skip (ephemeral or redundant in the notebook context):
- Bootstraps — these are orientation tools for the immediate next
  session, not deep archive material. The transcript already contains
  everything the bootstrap summarizes.
- Session logs — like bootstraps, these summarize what the transcript
  contains in full. However, uploading session logs is not harmful and
  some practitioners prefer the convenience of querying structured
  summaries. This is a preference, not a rule.

The guiding principle: the notebook should contain the materials that
a future session might need to query for deep context recovery. If a
document exists only to facilitate the immediate next session (bootstrap)
or to summarize what the transcript already captures in full (session
log), it adds limited retrieval value.

Cross-reference: Section 4.3.3 includes notebook upload in the user
closeout duties. TPL-003 (Session Closeout Checklist) Part B includes
notebook sync as a post-session action.


10.3.4 Notebook Organization Strategy
---------------------------------------

As a project accumulates sessions and materials, notebook organization
becomes important for retrieval quality and source management.

ONE MAIN, ADJUNCTS AS NEEDED:

The general rule: maintain one main notebook for the project. All
sessions and branches should feed into this central repository so that
any query has access to the project's full history.

Create adjunct notebooks for targeted purposes:
- Branch-specific notebooks when a branch generates substantial
  independent context that would dilute the main notebook
- External research repositories that serve multiple projects
- Specification or reference documentation that benefits from
  isolation (e.g., a regulatory compliance corpus)

Example from field testing: a project maintained one main notebook
(91 sources spanning the full project lifecycle) plus two adjunct
notebooks — one for a specialized testing branch (33 sources) and one
for a tooling integration branch (21 sources). All three were
accessible to any session via MCP, with the Bootstrap specifying which
notebooks to consult and for what purpose.

NAMING CONVENTIONS:

Notebook names should include the project handle and a descriptive
purpose:
- [PROJECT-HANDLE] Review Material (main notebook)
- [PROJECT-HANDLE] [Branch Name] Sessions (branch adjunct)
- [PROJECT-HANDLE] Research Sources (research adjunct)

QUERYABILITY:

Good retrieval depends on good input. Practices that improve queryability:
- Consistent terminology across sessions (the notebook indexes terms)
- Descriptive artifact names that surface in search results
- Structured documents (findings reports, session logs) that contain
  clear section headings and identifiers
- Consistent use of decision IDs (D-###), finding IDs (F##), and
  response indexes ([####]) throughout materials


10.3.5 Source Efficiency for Limited Plans
-------------------------------------------

Notebook connectivity tools may impose limits on the number of sources
(uploaded documents) per notebook. For users on limited plans, source
efficiency becomes a practical concern.

CONSOLIDATION TECHNIQUE:

Rather than uploading each session transcript as a separate source,
consolidate multiple transcripts into a single document:

1. Create a Google Doc (or equivalent) with a clear heading structure
2. After each session, append the transcript under a new heading
   (e.g., "Session 034 — Session Lifecycle Drafting")
3. Upload or sync this single document as one source in the notebook

This approach allows many sessions of context to occupy a single source
slot. The notebook tool indexes the full content regardless of how many
sessions are consolidated within it.

TRADE-OFFS:

Consolidation trades organizational clarity for source efficiency. A
notebook with individual session transcripts is easier to navigate by
session; a notebook with consolidated documents is more source-efficient.
For projects with many sessions on limited plans, the efficiency benefit
typically outweighs the organizational cost.

When using consolidation, maintain a clear heading structure within the
consolidated document so that retrieval results can identify which
session the content came from.


10.3.6 Notebook Index / Directory
----------------------------------

When a project uses multiple notebooks (main plus adjuncts, or notebooks
shared across projects), the AI benefits from a directory that maps the
available notebooks to their contents and purposes.

THE NOTEBOOK INDEX:

A notebook index is a simple reference document — stored in the
project's materials or embedded in the Bootstrap — that lists:

- Notebook name
- Notebook ID (for MCP connectivity)
- Brief description of contents
- Typical query purposes (what questions this notebook can answer)

Example:

  NOTEBOOK DIRECTORY
  ------------------
  1. PROJ Review Material: a0b1c2d3-...
     Contents: Manual v1.0.7, all session transcripts, specifications
     Query for: Current state of deliverables, prior decisions, session
     history, artifact content

  2. PROJ Testing Sessions: e4f5g6h7-...
     Contents: Testing branch transcripts, test results, findings
     Query for: Test outcomes, validated patterns, failure modes

  3. PROJ Research Sources: i8j9k0l1-...
     Contents: External research, reference documents, specifications
     Query for: Source material, citations, technical references

CREATING THE INDEX:

Query each notebook with: "Provide a summary of your contents — what
topics, sessions, and materials are represented here." Compile the
summaries into the directory document. Update when notebooks are
reorganized or when significant new content is added.

PLACEMENT:

The Bootstrap's Materials Required section should reference the notebook
index or embed it directly (see TPL-002, Notebook Connectivity block).
This ensures every session begins with the AI knowing where to look
for different categories of context.


10.3.7 Search and Indexing Tools
---------------------------------

Beyond notebook connectivity, desktop search applications index local
files for rapid retrieval. When AI work references historical documents,
fast local search reduces friction in locating specific files, prior
versions, or archived materials.

Desktop search is complementary to notebook connectivity — it operates
on the local file system while notebook connectivity operates on the
uploaded project corpus. Both serve retrieval but at different layers.


10.3.8 Reference Managers
---------------------------

For research-intensive projects, reference management tools (Zotero,
Mendeley, or similar) organize source materials with metadata that
supports later retrieval and citation. These tools are particularly
valuable when AI-assisted work involves literature review, regulatory
research, or any domain where source tracking matters.

Reference managers can also feed notebook connectivity tools — export
collections as documents for upload, creating a queryable research
corpus within the project notebook.


Cross-reference: Section 4.4 (Connector Transparency Protocol) governs
how AI narrates notebook queries for transcript completeness. Section
10.8 provides user-side workflow tips including pre-session checklists.
Section 12.1 covers notebook connectivity as a continuity mechanism.

  enhancement connecting to notebook connectivity)

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH:
- Section 4.3.3 (Session Closeout) → references notebook upload in
  user duties (Session B draft already includes this)
- Section 4.4 (Connector Transparency Protocol) → governs narration
  of notebook queries (Session C draft — this session)
- Section 6 → notebook organization guidance (Session C draft — this
  session)
- Section 10.8 → existing NotebookLM Integration tips should cross-ref
  to this expanded section; consider whether 10.8's notebook content
  should be consolidated here or retained as user-side quick reference
- Section 12.1 → notebook connectivity as continuity mechanism
  (Session C draft — this session)
- TPL-002 → Notebook Connectivity block in Materials Required (Session
  B draft already includes this)

CONSISTENCY WITH SESSION A-B DRAFTS:
- TPL-002 v2.0 includes Notebook Connectivity within Materials Required
  — this section provides the full specification for what that Bootstrap
  block references
- Section 4.3.3 closeout protocol includes user duty to upload
  transcript and artifacts to notebook — this section provides the
  detailed workflow (10.3.3)
- TPL-001 v2.0 Revision 5 adds Notebook Connectivity section to the
  Project Initiation Form — this section provides the operational
  guidance that TPL-001 introduces during rooting
- Section 12.1 (Session B additions) references notebook-based context
  recovery in the Response Indexing discussion — this section provides
  the full capability description

SECTION 10.8 CONSIDERATION:
The existing Section 10.8 includes a "NotebookLM Integration" subsection
(lines 4604-4610) that partially overlaps with this new content. During
Session G integration, evaluate whether to:
(a) Retain 10.8's notebook content as a condensed user-side quick
    reference with a cross-reference to 10.3 for detail, or
(b) Consolidate all notebook content into 10.3 and remove the 10.8
    duplicate

Recommendation: Option (a) — retain the 10.8 quick reference. Section
10.3 is the comprehensive treatment for understanding; Section 10.8 is
the quick checklist for doing. Both serve valid purposes.
