DRAFT — SECTION 5.9 BACKLOG REGISTER (ENHANCEMENT — INSIGHT CAPTURE)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 5.9 (renumbered from current 5.7 per v1.0.8
                 structural changes)
                 ENHANCEMENT — adds new subsections to existing content
Current Lines:   3058-3166 in v1.0.7 (Section 5.7)
Drafted:         Session 036
Category:        9 (Insight Capture / Out-of-Phase Backlog) from
                 Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE: The existing Section 5.7 content (now 5.9) is well-structured
and adequate. This enhancement adds the Insight Capture Protocol as a
formal mechanism for populating the Backlog Register — the "how items
get captured" that complements the existing "how items are organized
and tracked."

The existing subsections are retained:
- 5.9.1 Definition (current 5.7.1 — unchanged)
- 5.9.2 The Reporting Triad (current 5.7.2 — unchanged)
- 5.9.3 Register Sections (current 5.7.3 — unchanged)
- 5.9.4 Maintenance Pattern (current 5.7.4 — enhanced)
- 5.9.5 Phase Traceability (current 5.7.5 — unchanged)
- 5.9.6 Template Reference (current 5.7.6 — updated ref)
- 5.9.7 Insight Capture Protocol (NEW — this draft)
- 5.9.8 Backlog Evaluation Sessions (NEW — this draft)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT 1: Section 5.9.4 Maintenance Pattern — ENHANCE existing
"AI Coordinator Role" content
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE the existing "AI Coordinator Role" paragraph with expanded
version:

AI Coordinator Role:

The AI maintains the Backlog Register as part of its coordinator duties.
This includes both reactive capture (responding to user-flagged items)
and proactive detection (identifying scope-adjacent content through the
Insight Capture Protocol — see Section 5.9.7).

Specific duties:
- Proactively detects scope expansion and proposes backlog capture
  (Scope Monitoring Duty)
- Conducts the brief containable survey when backlog capture is
  triggered
- Generates Backlog Item entries with proper schema and provenance
- Updates the register at session closeout
- Reviews register contents at phase transitions
- Flags patterns (e.g., excessive deferrals from one phase may indicate
  scope problems; recurring items across sessions may indicate
  unresolved needs)

The AI's Scope Monitoring Duty (Section [Session E placeholder])
requires continuous attention to whether emerging work falls within
or outside the current phase scope. When work appears to cross scope
boundaries, the AI does not silently expand scope — it pauses, flags
the expansion, and offers the Insight Capture Protocol as a structured
way to preserve the idea without disrupting current work.

ENHANCEMENT 2: New Section 5.9.7 — INSERT after Section 5.9.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT:

5.9.7 Insight Capture Protocol
---------------------------------

The Insight Capture Protocol provides a formal mechanism for capturing
valuable ideas, observations, and out-of-scope work items that arise
during active sessions. It prevents two competing risks: scope creep
(pursuing every interesting tangent) and idea loss (letting valuable
observations disappear into transcript history).

The protocol operates in two phases across different temporal contexts.

PHASE 1 — CAPTURE (In-Session):

Capture occurs in real-time when an out-of-scope item surfaces during
active work. The process is designed to be minimally disruptive —
typically 2-3 minutes of focused exchange before returning to current
scope.

Trigger: The capture protocol is triggered when:
- The AI detects scope expansion through its Scope Monitoring Duty
  (proactive detection)
- The user flags an idea that falls outside current scope
  ("That's a good idea for later" or "We should backlog that")
- An unexpected discovery during research or execution has implications
  beyond the current phase

AI Detection Guidance: The AI should recognize scope expansion signals
including:
- Ideas that reference future phases or versions
- Work items that depend on capabilities not yet established
- Observations that are valuable but tangential to current objectives
- User enthusiasm for a direction that diverges from agreed scope
- Requests that would require new tools, templates, or processes not
  in the current phase's scope

Capture Sequence:

1. PAUSE. The AI pauses current work and names the observation:
   "This appears to extend beyond our current phase scope — [brief
   characterization]. Shall I capture it as a backlog item?"

2. USER DECISION. The user responds:
   - "Yes, capture it" → proceed to step 3
   - "No, let's pursue it now" → scope expansion (requires formal
     decision per Section [Scope Monitoring])
   - "No, discard" → return to current work
   - "Let's discuss briefly" → brief exploration before deciding

3. BRIEF CONTAINABLE SURVEY. If capturing, the AI asks 3-5 targeted
   questions to document the item with enough context for future
   evaluation. The survey is containable — it has a defined end point
   and does not expand into full exploration.

   Standard survey questions:
   - What is the core idea or observation? (1-2 sentences)
   - What triggered this insight? (provenance)
   - How might this impact the project if pursued? (rough assessment)
   - Where do you think this belongs? (initial routing suggestion)
   - How urgent is this relative to current work? (priority signal)

   The AI may adapt or reduce these questions based on context. If the
   item is simple and well-understood, 2-3 questions may suffice.

4. GENERATE BACKLOG ITEM. The AI creates a structured Backlog Item
   entry using the schema below and confirms with the user.

5. RETURN TO SCOPE. Work immediately returns to the current session's
   objectives. The captured item is noted in the Session Log's Scope
   Observations section and the Backlog Register is updated.

BACKLOG ITEM SCHEMA:

Each captured item follows a seven-field schema:

| Field                | Content                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Item ID              | Backlog-Item-[NNN] (sequential, project-wide)  |
| Description          | Concise summary of the idea or observation     |
| Context / Provenance | What triggered the insight — session, activity, |
|                      | specific observation that surfaced the item     |
| Potential Impact     | Rough assessment of value if pursued            |
| Suggested Routing    | Initial thought on where the item belongs:      |
|                      | new feature, future task, document update,      |
|                      | process improvement, or uncertain               |
| Priority Assessment  | HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW (initial estimate, subject  |
|                      | to re-evaluation during Phase 2)                |
| Status               | CAPTURED (initial status upon creation)         |

STATUS LIFECYCLE:

Backlog items progress through three statuses:

CAPTURED: The item has been documented through the Insight Capture
Protocol. It has provenance data and an initial assessment but has not
been formally evaluated. All items begin here.

EVALUATED: The item has been reviewed in a Backlog Evaluation Session
(Section 5.9.8). Its priority has been confirmed or adjusted, its
routing has been determined, and a decision has been made about whether
and when to act on it.

ROUTED: The item has been assigned to its destination — a specific
phase, a branch, a document update, or discarded. Routed items leave
the active backlog and are tracked in their destination context.

The status lifecycle ensures that captured items do not languish
indefinitely. Items that remain in CAPTURED status across multiple
phases should be flagged for evaluation.


PHASE 2 — EVALUATION AND ROUTING (Dedicated Session):

Phase 2 occurs periodically — not in every session, but at natural
review points in the project lifecycle.

Evaluation Triggers:
- Phase transitions (before planning the next phase, review accumulated
  backlog items)
- Dedicated backlog evaluation sessions (scheduled when items accumulate)
- Project planning sessions that assess scope and priorities
- Pre-closure reviews (before project completion, disposition all
  remaining items)

The evaluation process:
1. Review all items in CAPTURED status
2. For each item, assess:
   - Is this still relevant given current project state?
   - Has this already been addressed through other work?
   - What is the revised priority given current context?
   - Where should this be routed?
3. Route each item to its destination:
   - New component or feature → add to project scope (requires
     formal decision)
   - Future task → assign to a specific phase or session
   - Document update → create a specific update task
   - Process improvement → add to process improvement register
   - Discard → mark as discarded with brief rationale
4. Update status to EVALUATED, then ROUTED once assigned

See Section 5.9.8 for guidance on structuring Backlog Evaluation
Sessions.

RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING BACKLOG REGISTER SECTIONS:

Items routed through the Insight Capture Protocol land in the existing
Backlog Register sections (5.9.3):

| Routing Destination   | Register Section          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| New feature / scope   | Current Project Backlog   |
| Future version item   | Version Backlog           |
| Process improvement   | Process Improvements      |
| Uncertain / deferred  | Parking Lot               |
| Discarded             | Removed (with note)       |

The Insight Capture Protocol is the input mechanism; the existing
Register sections are the organizational structure. Together, they
provide end-to-end lifecycle management for out-of-scope items.

ENHANCEMENT 3: New Section 5.9.8 — INSERT after Section 5.9.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT:

5.9.8 Backlog Evaluation Sessions
------------------------------------

When accumulated backlog items warrant dedicated review, a Backlog
Evaluation Session provides focused time to assess, prioritize, and
route items.

WHEN TO HOLD:

Backlog Evaluation is not a standalone session type — it is typically
a work block within a phase transition session, a planning session, or
a dedicated maintenance session. It can also be combined with other
review activities (Project Roadmap update, Phase Protocol evaluation).

Triggers for scheduling evaluation:
- 10+ items in CAPTURED status
- A phase transition is approaching
- Items have been in CAPTURED status for more than 3 sessions
- The user requests a backlog review

SESSION STRUCTURE:

1. Load the Backlog Register (or the relevant section)
2. Review items in CAPTURED status, oldest first
3. For each item, the AI presents the item and facilitates a brief
   assessment:
   - Is it still relevant?
   - Has the priority changed?
   - Where should it be routed?
4. User decides disposition for each item
5. AI updates item statuses and routes items to their destinations
6. Updated Register is saved as a session artifact

EFFICIENCY GUIDANCE:

Backlog evaluation should be efficient — spend proportional time on
each item. Simple items (clear routing, obvious priority) need only
a confirmation. Complex items (uncertain value, multiple possible
destinations) warrant brief discussion.

Target pace: 2-3 minutes per item for simple items, 5-10 minutes for
complex items. A session reviewing 15 items should take roughly 30-60
minutes, not an entire session.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT 4: Section 5.9.6 Template Reference — UPDATE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE existing template reference:

5.9.6 Template Reference
--------------------------

Template TPL-023 (Backlog Register) provides the standard structure for
the register itself. The register is a living document updated
throughout the project lifecycle. At project closure, its contents
transfer to the Closure Report (TPL-022) Section 4.

The Insight Capture Protocol (Section 5.9.7) uses the Backlog Item
schema to create structured entries. Items captured through the protocol
are initially placed in the register's appropriate section based on
suggested routing, then formally evaluated and routed during Backlog
Evaluation Sessions (Section 5.9.8).

Cross-reference: Section 5.10 (Project Closure Report) for end-of-
project backlog disposition.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
- Enhancement 1: Replaces the "AI Coordinator Role" paragraph in
  existing Section 5.7.4 (renumbered to 5.9.4)
- Enhancement 2: New Section 5.9.7 after 5.9.6
- Enhancement 3: New Section 5.9.8 after 5.9.7
- Enhancement 4: Updates existing 5.9.6 template reference

NUMBERING:
All existing subsection numbers shift from 5.7.x to 5.9.x per the
v1.0.8 renumbering. Content within existing subsections is unchanged
except as noted above.

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH IN SESSION G:
- Section 4.3.2 (Active Session Management): Already says "Defer
  out-of-scope items to the Backlog Register" — enhance to reference
  the Insight Capture Protocol (integration point drafted this session)
- Section 2.7 or equivalent (AI Duties): Scope Monitoring Duty should
  reference the Insight Capture Protocol as its constructive outlet
- Session E: Scope Monitoring Duty section (Category 10/11) should
  cross-reference 5.9.7 for the capture mechanism
- Section 4.3.3 (Closeout): Session closeout already reviews backlog
  items — consistent with 5.9.4 maintenance pattern
- TPL-023 (Backlog Register template): May benefit from adding the
  Backlog Item schema fields alongside the existing BL-### format.
  Evaluate in Session G whether TPL-023 needs revision or whether
  the schema in 5.9.7 is the authoritative specification.

CONSISTENCY WITH PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session B Section 4.3.2 (Active Session Management): Contains
  "Defer out-of-scope items to the Backlog Register or appropriate
  future sessions" — the Insight Capture Protocol formalizes this
  existing guidance with a structured mechanism
- Session B TPL-003 v2.0 (Closeout Checklist): Step 1 Loose Ends
  Assessment includes scope items review — consistent with backlog
  capture at closeout
- Session A Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol): Layer 1 behaviors include
  scope management — the Scope Monitoring Duty is the implementation
  of this behavioral requirement

RELATIONSHIP TO CATEGORY 10 (SESSION E):
Category 10 includes the Scope Monitoring Duty specification. The
Insight Capture Protocol (this draft) is the constructive outlet for
scope monitoring. Session E should cross-reference this section when
drafting the Scope Monitoring Duty — the duty detects; the protocol
captures.

DESIGN DECISION — UNIFIED PLACEMENT:
The Insight Capture Protocol is placed entirely within Section 5.9
(Backlog Register) rather than split between Section 4 (behavioral
protocol) and Section 5 (artifact structure). Rationale: the capture
mechanism and the repository are tightly coupled — the protocol exists
to populate the register. Splitting them would require readers to
cross-reference two sections to understand a single workflow. Section 4
receives a lightweight cross-reference (integration point) directing
readers to 5.9.7 for the full protocol.
