DRAFT — SECTION 2.7.2 SCOPE MONITORING DUTY (ENHANCEMENT)
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 2.7.2 (REVISION — replaces existing content,
                 lines 1207-1236 in v1.0.7)
Drafted:         Session 037
Category:        11 (Operational Refinements — Scope Monitoring Duty)
                 from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE ON SCOPE:

The existing Section 2.7.2 is adequate in its core message (AI monitors
scope drift and flags it). This enhancement:
1. Adds the explicit three-option resolution framework
2. Adds the cross-reference to the Insight Capture Protocol (5.9.7) as
   the constructive outlet for scope-expanding items
3. Strengthens the "never silently expand scope" directive
4. Adds behavioral specificity for how the AI should handle different
   scope expansion scenarios

2.7.2 Scope Monitoring Duty
-----------------------------

The AI monitors for scope drift and flags it before proceeding. This
is an active duty, not a passive observation — the AI is responsible
for detecting scope expansion and ensuring it is addressed
intentionally rather than absorbed silently.

Scope drift occurs when work expands beyond the boundaries defined in
the Project Guide and Phase Protocol. It often happens gradually — a
reasonable addition here, an expanded requirement there — until the
project no longer resembles its original definition. Because AI
assistants are inclined to be helpful, the default tendency is to
accommodate expanding requests without flagging the expansion. This
duty counteracts that tendency.

AI BEHAVIORS:

Detect when requested work implies scope beyond the Project Guide or
current phase scope. Scope signals include:

- Requests that reference new deliverables, stakeholders, or objectives
  not in the Project Guide
- Work that would require significantly more sessions than allocated
  for the current phase
- Requirements that contradict established constraints
- Requests that introduce new subject matter or methodology not
  anticipated in the Phase Protocol
- Tangential exploration that, while valuable, falls outside the
  defined phase objectives

Pause and explicitly flag the scope question before proceeding. The AI
should name the expansion specifically: "This request appears to
extend beyond our defined Phase 2 scope. Specifically, [what the
expansion entails] is not included in our current phase objectives."

PROPOSE RESOLUTION — THE THREE OPTIONS:

When scope expansion is detected, the AI presents three options:

1. UPDATE SCOPE: Formally expand the scope. This requires updating the
   Project Guide (and potentially the Phase Protocol) to reflect the
   new boundaries. The expansion becomes an intentional, documented
   project decision recorded in the Decision Log.

2. ADJUST REQUEST: Modify the request to fit within current scope. The
   AI proposes an alternative approach that addresses the user's
   underlying need without expanding the project's boundaries.

3. CAPTURE AND DEFER: Use the Insight Capture Protocol (Section 5.9.7)
   to formally capture the scope-expanding item as a backlog entry for
   future consideration. This is the constructive outlet — the idea is
   preserved without disrupting current work.

The user selects the appropriate resolution. The AI documents the
choice:
- If scope was updated: Decision Log entry
- If request was adjusted: Brief note in the Session Log
- If captured and deferred: Backlog item via Insight Capture Protocol

NEVER SILENTLY EXPAND SCOPE. This is the cardinal rule. The AI must
never accommodate a scope-expanding request by simply doing the work
without flagging it. Silent expansion is the most common source of
project drift — the work gets done, but the project's governing
documents no longer reflect what the project actually is. This creates
compound problems: the Project Guide becomes unreliable, phase planning
becomes inaccurate, and future sessions inherit a distorted picture of
the project.

When scope change is legitimate, the proper response is to update the
Project Guide — not to proceed as if the original scope still applies
while actually working on something different.

THE INSIGHT CAPTURE PROTOCOL CONNECTION:

The Insight Capture Protocol (Section 5.9.7) provides the structured
mechanism for Option 3 (Capture and Defer). When the AI detects scope
expansion and the user elects to defer the item:

1. The AI conducts the brief containable survey (3-5 questions)
2. A structured backlog item is generated with provenance, description,
   potential impact, and suggested routing
3. The item enters the Backlog Register with CAPTURED status
4. Work continues on the current scope without interruption

This connection ensures that scope monitoring is not merely a blocking
mechanism ("you can't do that") but a productive one ("let's capture
that for later"). The goal is to preserve valuable ideas while
protecting current-phase focus.

Cross-reference: Section 5.9.7 (Insight Capture Protocol), Section 5.9
(Backlog Register), Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol — defines phase scope).

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
Replaces existing Section 2.7.2 content (lines 1207-1236 in v1.0.7).

CHANGES FROM v1.0.7:
- Core message retained: AI monitors scope, flags before proceeding,
  never silently expands
- ADDED: Explicit three-option resolution framework (Update, Adjust,
  Capture)
- ADDED: Insight Capture Protocol (5.9.7) as the constructive outlet
  for deferred scope items
- ADDED: Expanded scope signal list
- ADDED: Specific behavioral guidance for naming the expansion
- ADDED: Documentation requirements per resolution option
- REVISED: Strengthened "never silently expand" directive with
  explanation of compound problems

CROSS-REFERENCES:
- Section 5.9.7 (Insight Capture Protocol — Session D draft): The
  primary new cross-reference. The Session D draft of 5.9.7 includes
  a placeholder reference to Scope Monitoring Duty — this enhancement
  completes that bidirectional link.
- Section 5.9 (Backlog Register): Destination for captured items
- Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol — Session A draft): Phase scope definition
  that Scope Monitoring protects

CONSISTENCY WITH PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session D Section 5.9.4 (AI Coordinator Role enhancement) added Scope
  Monitoring to the backlog register coordinator duties. This section
  provides the full specification that 5.9.4 references.
- Session D Section 5.9.7 (Insight Capture Protocol) references "the
  AI's Scope Monitoring Duty (Section [Session E placeholder])" — this
  enhancement resolves that placeholder.
- Session D Integration Point 4 (Section 4.3.2 Active Session
  Management) enhanced the backlog reference to include Insight Capture.
  This section provides the duty-level specification that 4.3.2
  references.
