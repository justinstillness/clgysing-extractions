QUALITY AUDIT — SECTION 14 FAILURE MODES
================================================================================
Audited:    Session 037
Category:   Drafting Plan Session E, Item 6
Purpose:    Assess whether conflict resolution belongs here; prepare
            for Session F additions (Category 13)
Status:     COMPLETE — assessment only, no content changes
================================================================================


AUDIT ASSESSMENT:

Section 14 currently contains three subsections:
- 14.1 Common Pitfalls (Context, Communication, Process, Output failures)
- 14.2 Recovery Strategies (Immediate, Local, Session-Level, Project-Level)
- 14.3 Cognitive Divergence Detection (understanding, detection, protocol,
  prevention)

OVERALL QUALITY: SOLID. The section is well-organized with clear
categories, practical examples, and actionable recovery guidance. The
Cognitive Divergence Detection subsection (14.3) is particularly strong
— the Three-Strike Protocol and detection signals are field-relevant.


CONFLICT RESOLUTION PLACEMENT DECISION:

Assessment: Section 4.5 (Session Management) is the correct home for
the Conflict Resolution Protocol. Section 14 documents failure modes
and recovery — things that go wrong and how to fix them. The Conflict
Resolution Protocol is an operational behavior for handling a specific
class of situation (protocol-vs-objective tension) during normal work.
It is preventive, not reactive.

However, Section 14 should CROSS-REFERENCE the Conflict Resolution
Protocol for two relevant failure modes:

1. PROTOCOL RIGIDITY failure mode: AI follows protocols rigidly when
   doing so harms project objectives. Mitigation: Section 4.5 (Conflict
   Resolution Protocol).

2. SILENT DEVIATION failure mode: AI deviates from protocol without
   flagging the deviation. Mitigation: Section 4.5 (Conflict Resolution
   Protocol) — specifically, the requirement to FLAG before deviating.

These two failure modes should be added during Session F when Category
13 (Known Failure Modes & Workarounds) is drafted.


SESSION F PREPARATION — CATEGORY 13 GAPS IDENTIFIED:

The current Section 14 has the following gaps relative to Category 13
from the Findings document:

1. NO BOOTSTRAP VERIFICATION FAILURE MODE: Category 13.1 identifies
   bootstraps that are acknowledged but not actually followed. Section
   14 does not address this. Session F should add it.

2. NO BEHAVIORAL FORGETFULNESS FAILURE MODE: Category 13.2 identifies
   AI "forgetting" committed behaviors mid-session. Section 14's
   "Session overrun" entry partially covers this (quality degradation
   from context exhaustion) but does not address behavioral
   forgetfulness independent of exhaustion. Session F should add it.

3. NO CONTAMINATION FAILURE MODE: Category 13.3 identifies hallucinated
   connections across unrelated content. Section 14's "Hallucination"
   entry covers fabricated information but not cross-contamination
   between sources. Session F should distinguish these.

4. NO SYNTHESIS LAYER DEGRADATION: Category 13.4 identifies extraction
   fidelity vs. synthesis error distinction (particularly relevant for
   notebook-mediated context recovery). No equivalent in current
   Section 14. Session F should add it.

5. NO CONTEXT INVISIBILITY (TRANSCRIPT GAPS): Category 13.5 identifies
   MCP tool calls invisible in transcript. This is now mitigated by the
   Connector Transparency Protocol (Section 4.4, Session C). Section 14
   should document the failure mode and cross-reference the CTP as
   mitigation.

6. NO PROTOCOL RIGIDITY / SILENT DEVIATION: As noted above, these
   should be added with cross-references to Section 4.5.

7. NO RUNAWAY EXECUTION: The failure mode addressed by Instruction
   Chain Interpretation (Section 3.8, this session). Should be
   documented in Section 14 with mitigation cross-reference.

RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE FOR SESSION F:

The current Section 14 structure (14.1 Pitfalls, 14.2 Recovery, 14.3
Divergence) could be enhanced by:

Option A — Extend 14.1: Add the new failure modes as additional entries
within the existing category structure (Context, Communication, Process,
Output failures). This preserves the current organization.

Option B — Add 14.4: Create a new subsection for "Field-Tested Failure
Modes" that documents failures discovered through real-world testing,
with explicit workaround documentation. This separates the original
analytical catalog from empirically validated patterns.

Recommendation: Option A is cleaner. The existing categories
accommodate the new failure modes naturally:
- Bootstrap verification, behavioral forgetfulness, runaway execution
  → Process Failures
- Contamination, synthesis degradation → Output Failures
- Context invisibility → Context Failures (or new "Tool Failures"
  category)
- Protocol rigidity, silent deviation → Process Failures

Each new entry should follow the existing format: name, description,
symptoms, prevention/mitigation with cross-references to the specific
manual sections that address them.
