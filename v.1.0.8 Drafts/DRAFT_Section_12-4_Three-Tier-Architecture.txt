DRAFT — SECTION 12.4 THREE-TIER DOCUMENTATION ARCHITECTURE (NEW)
================================================================================
Target Location: NEW Section 12.4 (after Section 12.3 Branch Management)
Drafted:         Session 038
Category:        12 (Three-Tier Documentation Architecture) from
                 Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE ON PLACEMENT:

Section 12 (Extended Context) covers multi-session continuity (12.1),
complex project management (12.2), and branch management (12.3). The
Three-Tier Documentation Architecture fits naturally here as a pattern
for managing documentation complexity in substantial projects — a
structural concern that spans sessions and phases.

Alternative considered: Section 6 (External Organization). The case
for Section 6 is that documentation architecture is an organizational
concern. However, Section 6 focuses on the physical file system —
naming conventions, folder structures, notebook organization. The
Three-Tier Architecture is a conceptual pattern for how documentation
is structured and maintained, which is a higher-order concern that
belongs in Section 12's treatment of complex project management.

12.4 Three-Tier Documentation Architecture
--------------------------------------------

12.4.1 The Problem: Documentation Sprawl
------------------------------------------

As projects grow in complexity, documentation tends toward one of two
failure modes.

Monolithic specifications: All documentation lives in a single large
file that becomes increasingly difficult to navigate, update, and
maintain. Changes to one component require editing a document that
covers the entire system. The file grows until it exceeds practical
working limits for both humans and AI context windows.

Scattered fragments: Documentation is spread across many small files
with no clear hierarchy or relationship between them. Finding
authoritative information requires knowing which file to check, and
updates may be made in one location while related content elsewhere
becomes stale.

The Three-Tier Documentation Architecture solves both problems by
separating documentation into three levels with distinct purposes,
update cadences, and scopes.


12.4.2 The Three Tiers
------------------------

TIER 1: ARCHITECTURE REFERENCE (SYSTEM LEVEL)

Purpose: High-level blueprint of the system, project, or deliverable.
Captures design philosophy, component relationships, and structural
decisions.

Content includes:
- System topology or project architecture
- Component inventory and interrelationships
- Design principles and governing decisions
- Scope boundaries and constraints

Stability: High. Architecture references change rarely — only when the
fundamental structure of the system changes. They provide the stable
foundation that the other tiers reference.

Update trigger: Major structural changes, new components added or
removed, fundamental design philosophy shifts.

Naming convention: [VERSION]_SPEC_[System]-Architecture-Reference.[ext]
Example: v4.0_SPEC_HA-Suite-Architecture-Reference.txt

Characteristics:
- Written for orientation — a reader encountering the project for the
  first time should be able to understand the overall structure from
  this document alone
- Comprehensive but not granular — it maps the territory without
  describing every feature of the terrain
- Maintained as a single authoritative file per system or major
  subsystem

TIER 2: PER-TOOL / PER-COMPONENT REFERENCES (OPERATIONAL LEVEL)

Purpose: Detailed specifications for individual components, tools,
processes, or subsystems. Bridges the architecture-level view to
operational execution.

Content includes:
- Component-specific specifications and parameters
- Operational procedures and usage guidance
- Configuration details and dependencies
- Troubleshooting and known issues

Stability: Medium. Component references update when the specific
component changes, but are unaffected by changes to other components.
This isolation is the key benefit — a change to Component A requires
updating only Component A's reference, not a monolithic document that
covers everything.

Update trigger: Component-specific changes — new features, modified
behaviors, updated configurations, resolved issues.

Naming convention: [VERSION]_REF_[Component]-Reference.[ext]
Example: v1.0_REF_Caliper-Tool-Reference.txt

Characteristics:
- Self-contained — each reference covers one component completely
- Consistent structure across references for the same system (common
  sections, shared formatting)
- Cross-references the Architecture Reference for system-level context
- Multiple references exist in parallel — one per component

TIER 3: CHANGELOG (TEMPORAL LEVEL)

Purpose: Sequential record of what changed, when, and why. Tracks the
evolution of the system over time.

Content includes:
- Reverse-chronological entries documenting changes
- Decision references for significant changes
- Version progression
- Session provenance (which session produced each change)

Stability: Continuously updated. Every session that modifies the system
adds to the changelog.

Update trigger: Any change to Tier 1 or Tier 2 documentation, any
significant implementation change, any relevant decision.

Naming convention: CHANGELOG.[ext] or [PROJECT]_CHANGELOG.[ext]
Example: CHANGELOG.txt

Characteristics:
- Append-only (reverse-chronological) — entries are added, never
  modified after the session that created them
- Provides temporal context that static specifications lack — why
  something is the way it is, what it replaced, what prompted the change
- Enables context recovery for AI sessions — querying the changelog
  reveals project evolution without requiring the AI to read every
  prior session
- May be backfilled for existing projects that adopt the pattern
  retroactively


12.4.3 When to Apply This Pattern
-----------------------------------

The Three-Tier Architecture is not needed for every project. It is
most valuable when:

- The project produces or manages a system with multiple distinct
  components
- Documentation would otherwise grow into an unwieldy monolithic file
- Multiple people or AI sessions need to reference documentation, and
  different sessions need different levels of detail
- Components evolve at different rates, making a single document
  difficult to maintain
- The project spans enough sessions that temporal context (what changed
  and when) becomes valuable for continuity

Projects that typically benefit:
- Software development with multiple tools or services
- Governance frameworks with multiple policy domains
- Research projects with multiple investigation threads
- Any project producing deliverables with distinct, independently
  evolving components

Projects where it may be unnecessary:
- Short projects (fewer than 5 sessions)
- Single-deliverable projects with no component structure
- Projects where all documentation fits comfortably in one file

The decision to adopt the Three-Tier Architecture should be made during
rooting (Phase 0) or at a phase transition when documentation complexity
has become apparent. It can be recorded as a project decision in the
Decision Log.


12.4.4 Implementation Guidance
--------------------------------

CREATING THE INITIAL ARCHITECTURE:

When adopting the pattern for a new project:

1. Draft the Architecture Reference first. Map the system's components
   and relationships. This becomes the authoritative structural document
   that all other documentation references.

2. Create Component References for each major component. Use a
   consistent structure across all references for the same system —
   common sections (Purpose, Configuration, Usage, Known Issues) make
   references predictable and navigable.

3. Initialize the Changelog. If the project already has history, backfill
   from session logs and decision logs. If the project is new, the first
   entry documents the architecture's creation.

RETROFITTING AN EXISTING PROJECT:

When an existing project's documentation has outgrown a monolithic
structure:

1. Identify the component boundaries within the existing documentation.
2. Extract the Architecture Reference by distilling the high-level
   structure from the monolithic document.
3. Extract Component References by separating component-specific content
   into individual files.
4. Create the Changelog from existing session and decision logs.
5. Retire the monolithic document — archive it and redirect references
   to the new three-tier structure.

STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION:

Store all tiers in a dedicated documentation directory within the
project's file structure. A common pattern:

  /[PROJECT]/
  └── /docs/  (or /Documentation/)
      ├── [Architecture Reference]
      ├── [Component Reference 1]
      ├── [Component Reference 2]
      ├── [Component Reference N]
      └── CHANGELOG.txt

For projects using notebook connectivity, upload the Architecture
Reference and Component References to the project notebook. The
Changelog may be uploaded as well, but be mindful of source limits —
a very long changelog may be more efficient as a queryable document
than a full notebook source.


12.4.5 Relationship to Other Framework Elements
-------------------------------------------------

The Three-Tier Architecture integrates with the broader AIPM framework
at several points:

File Naming (Section 6.1): Tier naming conventions ([VERSION]_SPEC_,
[VERSION]_REF_, CHANGELOG) follow the project's naming standards and
include the project handle.

Notebook Organization (Section 6.2.4): Architecture and Component
References are prime candidates for notebook upload — they provide
high-value queryable context for AI sessions. The Changelog provides
temporal context that supports exhaustive querying.

Session Lifecycle (Section 4.3): When an AI session needs to understand
the system it's working on, the Architecture Reference is the first
document to reference. Component References are pulled as needed for
specific work. The Changelog provides recent evolution context.

Phase Transitions (Section 4.3.5): Phase transitions are natural
checkpoints for updating documentation tiers. The transition's
consolidation step (Step 2 of the 8-step process) should verify that
all three tiers reflect the completed phase's work.

Branch Management (Section 12.3): Branches may produce their own
Component References that are later integrated into the mainline
documentation structure.

Cross-reference: Section 6 (External Organization), Section 10.3
(Notebook Connectivity), Section 4.3.5 (Phase Transitions), Section
12.3 (Branch Management).


================================================================================
INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
New Section 12.4 after Section 12.3 (Branch Management).

FIELD-TESTED ORIGIN:
This pattern was formally adopted in Session 021 (Decision D-027) for
the Havona Anvil Suite project, replacing a monolithic v3.1
specification with:
- Tier 1: v4.0_SPEC_HA-Suite-Architecture-Reference.txt
- Tier 2: Individual references for SeraphRecorder, Caliper, Majeston
- Tier 3: CHANGELOG.txt (backfilled from Sessions 001-020)

The implementation produced approximately 83,000 characters of
structured documentation across five files, demonstrating the pattern's
scalability and practical effectiveness.

RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session C Section 6.2.4 (Notebook Organization): Aligns — notebook
  organization covers where to store documentation; Three-Tier covers
  how to structure it.
- Session D Section 12.3 (Branch Management): Complementary — branches
  may produce their own component references.
- Session B Section 12.1 (Multi-Session Continuity): The Changelog
  tier directly supports continuity by providing temporal context.

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH IN SESSION G:
- Section 6.1: Note that Three-Tier naming conventions extend the
  project's file naming standards
- Section 12.2 (Complex Project Management): Cross-reference to 12.4
  for documentation management in complex projects
- Glossary: Entry for "Three-Tier Documentation Architecture"
- TOC: Add 12.4 entry
