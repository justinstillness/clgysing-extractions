DRAFT — SECTION 2 CORE PHILOSOPHY ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================
Target Location: Section 2 — two targeted enhancements:
                 1. New Section 2.1.5 "Ceremony is Continuity"
                    (INSERT after 2.1.4 "Use the Full System")
                 2. Enhancement to Section 2.2.3 "Explicit Over Implicit"
                    (REVISE to incorporate "Alignment Over Assumption")
Drafted:         Session 037
Category:        11 (Operational Refinements — Ceremony is Continuity,
                 Alignment Over Assumption) from Revision Findings
Status:          DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

NOTE ON APPROACH:

These two philosophy items have been seeded throughout Sessions A-D
drafts (Phase Protocol references "ceremony is continuity," Session B
alignment turn embodies "alignment over assumption"). This draft
formalizes them as named principles in Section 2, giving them a
canonical home that the rest of the manual can reference.

BEGIN DRAFT CONTENT
================================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT 1: NEW SECTION 2.1.5 — INSERT after 2.1.4 "Use the Full
System" (after approximately line 738 in v1.0.7)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.5 Ceremony is Continuity
------------------------------

In human organizations, institutional memory lives in people — their
recollections, relationships, and tacit knowledge. AI-assisted work has
no such reservoir. Every session begins from zero. The AI retains
nothing from prior sessions. The user's memory, while persistent, is
incomplete and unstructured. Without deliberate action, every session
boundary is an amnesia event.

The solution is ceremony — the formal, deliberate production of
artifacts at predictable points in the workflow. Bootstraps at session
end. Session Logs with embedded fidelity reports. Decision Logs when
choices are made. Phase Protocols at phase boundaries. These are not
bureaucratic overhead. They are the continuity mechanism itself.

This is easy to misunderstand. In traditional work, documentation is a
record of what happened — useful but secondary to the work itself. In
AI-assisted work, documentation is what makes the work possible across
sessions. The Bootstrap does not merely describe the project state; it
is the project state, as far as the next session is concerned. The
Phase Protocol does not merely record behavioral expectations; it is
the behavioral governance that makes consistent execution possible.

The ceremonial artifacts — produced at the right moments, in the right
formats, with the right content — create the external memory that AI
work demands. Skip the ceremony, and the project loses its thread. Cut
corners on artifact quality, and continuity degrades. Treat closeout as
optional, and the next session starts from a weaker foundation.

This principle explains why the framework emphasizes full system
adoption (Section 2.1.4). Each artifact exists because its absence
created a real continuity failure in field testing. The system is
designed so that ceremony and productivity are not in tension — the
ceremonies are lightweight enough to be routine and valuable enough
to be non-negotiable.

The specific ceremonies and their timing are documented throughout the
manual: session initiation (Section 4.3.1), active session management
(Section 4.3.2), session closeout (Section 4.3.3), and phase
transitions (Section 4.3.5). The Phase Protocol (Section 5.2) is
itself a ceremonial artifact — reviewed at every session start as the
first act of behavioral alignment.

ENHANCEMENT 2: REVISE SECTION 2.2.3 — REPLACE existing content
(lines 788-801 in v1.0.7)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.3 Explicit Over Implicit — Alignment Over Assumption
----------------------------------------------------------

AI tools make assumptions to fill gaps in context. These assumptions
are often reasonable but sometimes wrong — and wrong assumptions
compound silently. The solution is aggressive explicitness.

State what you are doing and why. Articulate constraints even when they
seem obvious. Specify desired outputs in detail. Check for understanding
before proceeding.

This practice — developed in Section 3 as the Explicit Alignment
Principle — prevents the silent errors that plague AI-assisted work.
Over-explanation is quality control, not inefficiency.

The operational maxim is: propose and pause beats assume and proceed.

This applies to both parties. The AI should propose plans, approaches,
and interpretations — then pause for user confirmation rather than
proceeding on its best guess. Even when the path seems obvious, the AI
surfaces its understanding and waits for validation. The user, in turn,
should provide explicit direction rather than assuming the AI will
infer intent correctly.

The principle manifests throughout the framework:

The Alignment Turn (Section 4.3.1.1): At every session start, the AI
generates an alignment checklist and waits for confirmation before
beginning work. This is "propose and pause" at the session level.

Phase Transitions (Section 4.3.5): The AI presents the transition plan
and waits for user approval before proceeding to new phase work.
Transitions are explicit checkpoints, not automatic progressions.

Scope Monitoring (Section 2.7.2): When the AI detects potential scope
expansion, it pauses and flags the question rather than silently
accommodating the expansion.

Instruction Chain Interpretation (Section 3.X): Multi-step instructions
are treated as sequential with alignment checkpoints, not as batch
commands to execute without verification.

Closeout (Section 4.3.3): The user initiates closeout — the AI never
auto-initiates. Even the session ending is an explicit, user-confirmed
action.

The cost of explicit alignment is small: a few exchanges of
verification per session. The cost of implicit assumption is large:
wasted work, misaligned outputs, compounding drift across sessions.
When uncertain whether to check or to proceed, check.

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

PLACEMENT:
- Enhancement 1 (2.1.5): Insert after existing 2.1.4 "Use the Full
  System" (after approximately line 738). No renumbering required —
  this is a new subsection within the existing 2.1 structure.
- Enhancement 2 (2.2.3): Replaces existing 2.2.3 "Explicit Over
  Implicit" (lines 788-801). The section title changes to include
  "Alignment Over Assumption" as a named principle. The original
  content is retained and expanded.

CONTENT FROM v1.0.7 RETAINED:
- Enhancement 2 retains the first three paragraphs of existing 2.2.3
  (assumptions, aggressive explicitness, Explicit Alignment Principle
  reference). These are expanded with the "propose and pause"
  operational maxim and specific manifestation examples.

CONSISTENCY WITH PRIOR DRAFTS:
- Session A Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol): References "ceremony is
  continuity" as an underlying philosophy. This section provides the
  canonical definition.
- Session A Section 2.5.1 (Project Lifecycle): The rooting emphasis
  ("if rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions") reflects the
  ceremony-is-continuity philosophy.
- Session B Section 4.3.1.1 (Alignment Turn): Embodies "alignment over
  assumption" as a procedural requirement. This section provides the
  philosophical foundation.
- Session B Section 4.3.3 (Session Closeout): User-initiated-only
  trigger reflects "propose and pause" — the AI proposes closeout
  readiness, the user decides.
- Session E Section 3.X (Instruction Chain Interpretation — drafted
  this session): Referenced in Enhancement 2. Cross-reference will use
  the final section number assigned to that content.

CROSS-REFERENCES FROM THIS CONTENT:
- 2.1.5 references: Section 2.1.4, Section 4.3.1, Section 4.3.2,
  Section 4.3.3, Section 4.3.5, Section 5.2
- 2.2.3 references: Section 3 (Explicit Alignment Principle),
  Section 4.3.1.1, Section 4.3.5, Section 2.7.2, Section 3.X
  (Instruction Chain), Section 4.3.3

CROSS-REFERENCES TO ESTABLISH IN SESSION G:
- Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol): May reference 2.1.5 as the philosophy
  underlying the Phase Protocol concept
- Section 4.3.5 (Phase Transitions — this session's draft): Already
  references transition sessions as planning-heavy by design, which
  aligns with the ceremony-is-continuity philosophy
- Glossary (Section 17.2): Entries needed for "Ceremony is Continuity"
  and "Alignment Over Assumption" / "Propose and Pause"
