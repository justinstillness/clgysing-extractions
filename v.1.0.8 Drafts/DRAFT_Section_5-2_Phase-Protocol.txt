5.2 PHASE PROTOCOL
------------------

5.2.1 Definition
----------------

The Phase Protocol is a phase-stable governance document that tells the AI
how to behave throughout a given project phase. It sits between the Project
Guide and the Bootstrap in the document hierarchy, providing behavioral
continuity that persists across every session within a phase while remaining
specific enough to reflect the current phase's needs.

Where the Project Guide defines what the project is and the Bootstrap
defines where we left off, the Phase Protocol defines how work should be
conducted. It is the behavioral constitution for a phase — stable enough
to provide consistency, specific enough to provide relevance, and
structured enough to be actionable from the first response of every
session.


5.2.2 Purpose
-------------

The Phase Protocol serves four essential functions:

Behavioral Governance. It encodes the specific behaviors, protocols,
conventions, and standards that the AI must follow during the current
phase. Without it, each session begins with the AI operating from generic
defaults, and the user must re-establish behavioral expectations through
repeated instruction. The Phase Protocol eliminates this re-establishment
cost by making expectations persistent and reviewable.

Phase-Specific Context. Different phases of a project often require
different AI behaviors. A research phase may emphasize exhaustive
exploration and findings capture. A drafting phase may emphasize fidelity,
voice preservation, and segmentation discipline. A validation phase may
emphasize critical evaluation and gap detection. The Phase Protocol
tailors behavioral governance to the phase at hand.

Cross-Session Continuity. Because AI sessions are ephemeral, behavioral
instructions given in one session do not carry forward to the next. The
Phase Protocol solves this by encoding behavioral expectations in a
persistent document stored in Project Knowledge, where it survives session
boundaries and remains accessible to every session in the phase.

Onboarding Efficiency. When a new session begins, the AI can review the
Phase Protocol and immediately understand not just the project context
(from the Bootstrap and Project Guide) but the behavioral framework it
is expected to operate within. This dramatically reduces the orientation
overhead that would otherwise consume the opening exchanges of each
session.


5.2.3 The Three-Layer Architecture
----------------------------------

A Phase Protocol is organized into three distinct layers, each serving a
different scope of governance. This layered architecture enables reuse —
Layer 1 remains largely constant across projects, while Layers 2 and 3
adapt to specific contexts.

LAYER 1: AIPM FRAMEWORK BEHAVIORS (Universal)

Layer 1 contains the behavioral requirements that apply to every project
using the AIPM framework, regardless of subject matter or methodology.
These are the system-level behaviors that ensure continuity, quality, and
coordination.

Layer 1 typically includes:

- Session initiation protocols (Phase Protocol review confirmation,
  bootstrap acknowledgment, alignment turn sequence)
- Response indexing system (sequential numbering, semantic titles)
- Mandatory coordinator behaviors (scope monitoring, decision capture,
  continuity assurance, proactive orientation, document awareness,
  headroom opportunism)
- Work product presentation standards (formatting, file class
  designators, boundary markers)
- Token management protocols (headroom monitoring, segmentation triggers
  and methodology)
- Closeout protocol (user-initiated only, loose ends assessment,
  mandatory artifact generation)
- Conflict resolution protocol (stop, flag, explain, propose, await,
  document)
- Instruction chain interpretation rules (sequential with alignment
  checkpoints)

Layer 1 content is derived from this manual. When creating a Phase
Protocol for the first time, the AI draws these behaviors from its
knowledge of the AIPM framework. Over time, a user may develop a standard
Layer 1 block that can be reused across projects with minimal modification.

LAYER 2: SYSTEM/METHODOLOGY CONTEXT (Project-Type-Specific)

Layer 2 contains the methodology, knowledge management approach, or
domain framework that applies to the type of project being executed. This
layer bridges the universal AIPM behaviors and the specific project
content.

Examples of Layer 2 content:

- For a research writing project: extraction methodology, thesis
  architecture, argument block structure, voice and style parameters,
  citation standards
- For a software development project: coding standards, testing
  requirements, documentation conventions, version control workflow
- For a governance development project: document hierarchy, approval
  workflows, compliance requirements, stakeholder communication patterns
- For a consulting engagement: client communication standards, deliverable
  formats, review cycles, confidentiality protocols

Layer 2 is reusable across projects that share the same methodology. A
user who regularly conducts research writing projects may reuse the same
Layer 2 across multiple projects, modifying only the specifics.

LAYER 3: PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT (Unique to the Project)

Layer 3 contains the information unique to the specific project: its
subject matter, thesis, terminology, constraints, and any project-specific
behavioral requirements not covered by Layers 1 and 2.

Layer 3 typically includes:

- Project overview and core thesis/objective
- Key terminology and definitions specific to this project
- Subject matter frameworks or models being used
- Audience definition and accessibility requirements
- Project-specific conventions (naming, numbering, formatting)
- Phase structure overview (all phases, current phase highlighted)
- Integration points with other projects or systems
- Any behavioral requirements unique to this project

Layer 3 changes with every project. It is developed during rooting
(Phase 0) as part of the project foundation work.


5.2.4 Relationship to Other Documents
--------------------------------------

The Phase Protocol occupies a specific position in the document hierarchy,
and understanding this position is essential to using it correctly.

THE DOCUMENT STABILITY SPECTRUM:

  Project Guide          Phase Protocol          Bootstrap
  ─────────────────────  ─────────────────────  ─────────────────────
  PROJECT-STABLE         PHASE-STABLE           SESSION-SPECIFIC
  Changes rarely;        Static within a        Changes every session;
  updated only for       phase; redrafted at    captures current state
  material scope or      phase transitions      and forward-looking
  direction changes                             instructions

  Defines WHAT the       Defines HOW work       Defines WHERE we
  project is             should be conducted    left off

  Stored: Project        Stored: Project        Stored: Uploaded at
  Knowledge or           Knowledge              session start
  uploaded as needed

Each document draws from the one to its left. The Phase Protocol draws
from the Project Guide to create phase-specific behavioral guidance. The
Bootstrap draws from both the Project Guide and Phase Protocol to create
session-specific orientation.

THE BOOTSTRAP-PHASE PROTOCOL RELATIONSHIP:

The Bootstrap and Phase Protocol are complementary — sometimes described
as "cousins" in the document family. They work together but serve
distinct functions:

The Phase Protocol holds phase-stable behavioral governance: the rules,
standards, conventions, and protocols that remain constant throughout a
phase. It tells the AI how to behave.

The Bootstrap holds session-specific state and instructions: what happened
last session, what to do next, and what files to review. It tells the AI
where to look.

Critically, the Bootstrap serves as the prompt list that instructs the AI
to review files in Project Knowledge — including the Phase Protocol
itself. Files stored in Project Knowledge are not automatically read by
the AI; they must be explicitly referenced. The Bootstrap's mandatory
first action typically includes an instruction to review the Phase
Protocol.

This means the Bootstrap contains two types of content:

Dynamic elements that change every session: last session summary, next
actions, open items, headroom notes, session-specific instructions.

Stable elements that persist across the phase: instructions to review the
Phase Protocol, notebook references, recurring behavioral reminders, and
any standing instructions that apply to every session.

The stable elements of the Bootstrap tend to accumulate as a project
matures. When stable Bootstrap elements become numerous, this is often a
signal that an update to the Phase Protocol (or an addendum) may be
warranted — consolidating recurring instructions into the phase-stable
document rather than relying on their presence in every Bootstrap.

PROJECT KNOWLEDGE AND THE AUTO-READ REALITY:

A critical operational reality: placing a document in Project Knowledge
does not guarantee the AI will read it. The AI must be explicitly
instructed to review Project Knowledge documents. This instruction
typically lives in the Bootstrap as a mandatory first action.

The standard pattern is:

1. Phase Protocol is stored in Project Knowledge
2. Bootstrap includes: "MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Review the Phase Protocol
   in Project Knowledge and confirm adherence to all behavioral
   requirements"
3. AI reviews Phase Protocol and confirms
4. Session proceeds under Phase Protocol governance

If the Bootstrap omits this instruction, the Phase Protocol may go
unread, and behavioral governance for the session will default to
whatever the AI infers from context — which may be incomplete or
incorrect.


5.2.5 Phase Protocol Lifecycle
------------------------------

CREATION (During Rooting — Phase 0):

The Phase Protocol is created during rooting, the formal Phase 0 of every
project. Rooting produces two foundational outputs: the Project Guide and
the Base Phase Protocol.

The creation process is collaborative:

1. The user and AI establish the project's scope, deliverables, and phase
   structure (this becomes the Project Guide)
2. The AI drafts a Phase Protocol drawing from:
   - Layer 1: AIPM framework behaviors (from this manual or established
     templates)
   - Layer 2: Methodology appropriate to the project type
   - Layer 3: Project-specific context from the rooting conversation
3. The user reviews the draft Phase Protocol
4. Revisions are made until both parties are satisfied
5. The finalized Base Phase Protocol is stored in Project Knowledge
6. The first execution session's Bootstrap references the Phase Protocol
   as a mandatory first-action review item

The Base Phase Protocol is the "Phase 1 version" — it governs the first
execution phase of the project. It may be updated at phase transitions
or through addenda as the project evolves.

Cross-reference: See Section 2.5.1 for the complete rooting (Phase 0)
process.

STABILITY (Within a Phase):

Once created or redrafted, the Phase Protocol remains static for the
duration of the phase. This stability is a design feature, not a
limitation. It means that every session in a phase operates under the
same behavioral governance, creating consistency and predictability.

The Phase Protocol should not be casually modified mid-phase. If a
behavioral change is needed, the addendum mechanism (see below) provides
a controlled way to extend the protocol without destabilizing it.

EVOLUTION (At Phase Transitions):

When a project transitions from one phase to the next, the Phase Protocol
is evaluated and potentially redrafted. The phase transition process
(see Section 4.3.5) includes Phase Protocol evaluation as a formal step.

Phase Protocol redrafting triggers:

- Phase transition (mandatory evaluation; redraft if behaviors change)
- Significant methodology shift within a phase
- Accumulated addenda suggesting a clean redraft is warranted
- Feedback indicating current protocol is inadequate or misaligned

The redrafting process:

1. Review the current Phase Protocol against upcoming phase requirements
2. Identify which Layer 1 behaviors remain (typically all)
3. Identify which Layer 2 elements carry forward vs. need modification
4. Draft new Layer 3 content for the upcoming phase
5. Incorporate any addenda from the current phase that should persist
6. Remove any phase-specific content that no longer applies
7. Review and approve the redrafted protocol
8. Store the new Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge; archive the prior
   version

If behaviors do not change between phases, a full redraft may not be
necessary. The existing protocol can carry forward with a version note
indicating it has been reviewed and confirmed for the new phase. The
decision to redraft vs. carry forward should be made explicitly during
the phase transition, not assumed.

RETIREMENT (At Project Completion):

When the project concludes, the Phase Protocol is archived as part of
the project record. It may serve as a reference or template for future
projects using similar methodologies.


5.2.6 The Addendum Pattern
---------------------------

Mid-phase behavioral changes happen. A user discovers that the AI needs
a new behavior, or an existing behavior needs modification. Rather than
redrafting the entire Phase Protocol — which could introduce unintended
changes to stable content — the addendum pattern provides a controlled
extension mechanism.

WHEN TO USE AN ADDENDUM:

- A new behavioral requirement emerges during a phase
- An existing behavior needs modification but the change is narrow
- A user wants to add a standing instruction that should persist beyond
  the current session
- A temporary behavioral override is needed for the remainder of a phase

WHEN TO REDRAFT INSTEAD:

- Multiple addenda have accumulated, making the protocol fragmented
- The behavioral change is fundamental enough to affect multiple layers
- A phase transition is imminent (incorporate the change into the new
  phase's protocol)
- The addendum would contradict existing protocol content

THE ADDENDUM PROCESS:

1. User identifies the behavioral change needed (or the AI detects that
   a user instruction represents a persistent behavioral guideline)
2. The AI drafts an addendum document specifying:
   - What behavior is being added or modified
   - Why the change is needed
   - How it relates to existing protocol content
   - Whether it supersedes, extends, or supplements existing guidance
3. The addendum is stored in Project Knowledge alongside the Phase
   Protocol
4. The Bootstrap is updated to include the addendum in the mandatory
   review list
5. Subsequent sessions review both the Phase Protocol and its addenda

AI DETECTION RESPONSIBILITY:

The AI should be attentive to user instructions that imply persistent
behavioral changes. Signals include:

- "I want you to always [do X]"
- "From now on, [behave in Y way]"
- "Make sure you [do Z] every time"
- Any instruction that extends beyond the current session's scope

When the AI detects such a signal, it should surface the question:
"That sounds like a behavioral guideline you want carried forward beyond
this session. Should I draft a Phase Protocol addendum to capture this,
or is this just for the current session?"

This detection behavior is itself a Layer 1 AIPM framework behavior and
should be included in every Phase Protocol.


5.2.7 Phase Protocol Contents Reference

5.2.8 When to Create vs. When to Skip
--------------------------------------

Not every project requires a Phase Protocol. The decision depends on
project complexity and duration:

CREATE A PHASE PROTOCOL WHEN:

- The project spans multiple sessions (more than 2-3)
- The project has distinct phases with different behavioral requirements
- Specific AI behaviors, conventions, or standards must be consistent
  across sessions
- The project involves a specialized methodology (Layer 2 content)
- Multiple branches or parallel workstreams are anticipated
- The project involves collaboration where behavioral consistency matters

SKIP THE PHASE PROTOCOL WHEN:

- The project is a single-session task
- The project is simple enough that a Bootstrap alone provides adequate
  behavioral guidance
- No specialized behaviors beyond default AI operation are required
- The project has no distinct phases

When in doubt, create one. The cost of creating an unnecessary Phase
Protocol is low (one collaborative session during rooting). The cost of
not having one when needed is high (repeated behavioral re-establishment,
inconsistency across sessions, behavioral drift).


5.2.9 Maintenance Rules
------------------------

Update Triggers:
- Phase transition (mandatory evaluation, optional redraft)
- Addendum accumulation exceeding 3 addenda (consider clean redraft)
- User-identified behavioral gap or misalignment
- Methodology change affecting Layer 2 content
- AI detection of persistent behavioral instruction from user

Storage:
- Current Phase Protocol stored in Project Knowledge
- Superseded versions archived in /Phase Protocols/Old/ directory
- Addenda stored in Project Knowledge alongside the Phase Protocol

Naming Convention:
- Base Protocol: [VERSION]_PP_[PROJECT-HANDLE]-PHASE_[N]_Base-Protocol
- Addendum: [VERSION]_PP-SUPPLEMENT_[Descriptor]_(Session_[NNN])
- Example: v1.2_PP_CLGYSING-PHASE_1_Base-Protocol
- Example: v1.2_PP-SUPPLEMENT_Connector-Transparency-Protocol_(Session_010)

Version Discipline:
- New phase → new version number (v1.0 → v2.0)
- Addenda → increment minor version of the base (v1.0 → v1.1)
- Minor corrections → increment point version (v1.0 → v1.01)
