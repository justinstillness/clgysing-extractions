DRAFT — TPL-002 BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATE (MAJOR REVISION)
================================================================================
Target:     TPL-002 in Appendix A (REPLACES existing template)
Drafted:    Session 034
Category:   3 (Enhanced Session Lifecycle) from Revision Findings
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

REVISION RATIONALE:

The current TPL-002 is functional but does not reflect field-tested
bootstrap practices. Key gaps identified in Session 033 quality audit:
- No mention of Phase Protocol review as mandatory first action
- No concept of stable vs. dynamic content
- No behavioral reminder section
- No notebook connectivity references
- No response index continuity fields
- Continuation type doesn't reflect current best practice

This revision is informed by analysis of three field-tested bootstraps
spanning different projects and complexity levels:
- 034_bootstrap.txt (GOV-AIPM — high complexity, drafting session)
- 015_bootstrap.txt (NLMINTA — medium complexity, testing session)
- 024_bootstrap.txt (AWSNBLM — low-medium complexity, maintenance)

These real-world examples demonstrate evolved patterns that the template
should encode, including the mandatory first action block, dynamic state
sections, headroom management, and the stable/dynamic content split.

BEGIN REVISED TEMPLATE
================================================================================


TPL-002: BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATE

Template ID: GOV-AIPM-TPL-002
Version: 2.0
Purpose: Standard structure for session transitions; enables clean
         handoff between AI instances with full context preservation,
         behavioral continuity, and retrieval index maintenance.
When to Use:
- End of any chat session that will continue in a new chat
- When branching to a parallel workstream
- When approaching token limits
- When shifting focus requires fresh context

Cross-reference: Section 5.5 (Bootstrap Files), Section 4.3.3 (Session
Closeout), Section 5.2 (Phase Protocol)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete this Bootstrap at the end of a chat session before transitioning
to a new chat. The Bootstrap captures everything the next AI instance
needs to continue work without context loss.

The Bootstrap serves two functions:

1. Context Transfer — carrying forward the project state, decisions,
   and working context that the next AI instance needs.

2. Prompt List — explicit instructions telling the next AI what to do
   at session start, beginning with mandatory behavioral alignment.

WRITING PRINCIPLES:

Write for an AI that has no memory of previous chats. Be explicit about
what is decided versus what is still open. Include enough context to
orient, but not so much that it consumes the token budget needed for
substantive work.

The Bootstrap contains two categories of content:

STABLE CONTENT persists across multiple sessions within a phase. It
changes only when the project's standing instructions, tools, or
behavioral requirements change. Examples: mandatory first action,
notebook connectivity references, recurring behavioral reminders,
standing constraints.

DYNAMIC CONTENT changes every session. It reflects the current state
of work and must be freshly written at each closeout. Examples: prior
session summary, next actions, open items, headroom notes, response
index continuity.

As a project matures, stable content tends to grow. This is expected.
However, if stable content becomes unwieldy, consider consolidating some
of it into a Phase Protocol addendum — moving standing behavioral
instructions into the phase-stable document where they more naturally
belong.

DIALOG COMPLETION OPTION:
This template can be completed through dialog with the AI. Say:
"Help me complete TPL-002" or "Walk me through Bootstrap Template."
More commonly, the AI generates the Bootstrap proactively as part of
the Session Closeout Checklist (TPL-003) and the Continuity Assurance
Duty (Section 2.7.6).

Bootstrap Types:
- CONTINUATION: Same project, sequential work, picking up where left off
- BRANCH: Parallel workstream, may rejoin main trunk later
- NEW INSTANCE: Fresh start with new AI instance, full context transfer

================================================================================

[DYNAMIC CONTENT — Write fresh every session]

Session [###] accomplished:
- [Accomplishment 1]
- [Accomplishment 2]
- [Accomplishment 3]
- [Continue as needed]

================================================================================
MATERIALS REQUIRED
================================================================================

[MIXED — Stable items persist; dynamic items change per session]

UPLOADED:
- [File 1 — describe what it is and why it's needed]
- [File 2]

FROM PROJECT KNOWLEDGE:
- [Document 1 — e.g., Phase Protocol]
- [Document 2 — e.g., Connector Transparency Protocol supplement]

NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY:
- [Notebook Name]: [Notebook ID]
  ([Brief description of contents and purpose])
- [Notebook Name]: [Notebook ID]
  ([Brief description])

RESEARCH NEEDS:
- [Query 1 — what to look up and where]
- [Query 2]

================================================================================
DYNAMIC STATE — DECISION LOG CONTINUITY
================================================================================

[DYNAMIC CONTENT — Update every session]

Last decision recorded: [D-###]
NEXT DECISION NUMBER:   [D-###]

Active decisions carrying forward:
- [D-###]: [Brief description]
- [D-###]: [Brief description]

================================================================================
DYNAMIC STATE — RESPONSE INDEX CONTINUITY
================================================================================

[DYNAMIC CONTENT — Update every session]

Last session ended at index: [####]
NEXT SESSION STARTS AT INDEX: [####]

================================================================================
DYNAMIC STATE — PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
================================================================================

[DYNAMIC CONTENT — Update as criteria are met]

Phase [N] completion criteria (current status):

[✓] [Criterion 1] — COMPLETE
[✓] [Criterion 2] — COMPLETE
[~] [Criterion 3] — IN PROGRESS
[ ] [Criterion 4] — NOT STARTED

Assessment: Phase [N] approximately [XX]% complete.

================================================================================
HEADROOM MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

[DYNAMIC CONTENT — Assess per session]

Estimated session complexity: [LOW / MEDIUM / MEDIUM-HIGH / HIGH]
Token budget considerations:
- [Note 1 — e.g., "Section 4.3 revision is substantial"]
- [Note 2 — e.g., "Multiple templates to revise"]
- [Note 3 — e.g., "Will need notebook queries before drafting"]

Priority if headroom constrains:
1. [Highest priority item]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
[Continue as needed — establishes a graceful degradation path]

Monitor:
- [Specific headroom concern — e.g., "TPL-002 revision alone could be
  substantial — assess before starting"]

================================================================================
BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS
================================================================================

[STABLE CONTENT — Persists across sessions within phase]
[Include only behaviors that field testing shows are prone to being
forgotten or deprioritized, even when encoded in the Phase Protocol]

- [Reminder 1 — e.g., "Connector transparency: narrate all tool calls
  with tool ID, query details, intent, and result summary"]
- [Reminder 2 — e.g., "Produce discrete draft files, not inline content"]
- [Reminder 3 — e.g., "Maintain response indexing throughout session"]
- [Reminder 4 — project-specific convention or constraint]

These reminders reinforce Phase Protocol requirements that are critical
but historically prone to drift during extended sessions.

================================================================================
CONSTRAINTS AND PARAMETERS
================================================================================

[MIXED — Some persist, some are session-specific]

- [Constraint 1 — e.g., "Manual is 13,257 lines — work in targeted
  sections, not whole document"]
- [Constraint 2 — e.g., "Use Drafting Plan as authoritative scope guide"]
- [Constraint 3 — e.g., "Maintain version discipline (v1.0.8-DRAFT)"]
- [Constraint 4]

================================================================================
SESSION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

[STABLE CONTENT — Standard for all sessions]

MANDATORY OUTPUTS:
- [ ] Session Log (TPL-005) with embedded SFR generated at closeout
- [ ] Bootstrap (TPL-002) generated if project continues

- Any decision changes template design or manual structure
- Any decision will need to be referenced in future sessions
- User explicitly requests decision documentation

AI SELF-CHECK: Before closeout, evaluate: "Were decisions made this
session that future sessions will need to reference, or that affect the
project's direction?" If yes, generate Decision Log. If uncertain, ask
the user.

TEMPLATE NOTES
================================================================================

COMPARISON WITH v1.1 (PREVIOUS VERSION):

The following sections are NEW in v2.0:
- MANDATORY FIRST ACTION block (field-tested as essential)
- DYNAMIC STATE — RESPONSE INDEX CONTINUITY
- DYNAMIC STATE — PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
- HEADROOM MANAGEMENT (was implicit, now explicit)
- BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS (stable content reinforcement)
- NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY (within Materials Required)
- Stable/dynamic content labeling throughout

The following sections are REVISED in v2.0:
- INSTRUCTIONS: Added prompt-list function, stable/dynamic concept,
  addendum guidance
- PROJECT IDENTIFICATION: Added Horizon View, version tracking
- MATERIALS REQUIRED: Restructured with notebook connectivity
- SESSION REQUIREMENTS: Updated with SFR reference, user closeout duties
- CONSTRAINTS AND PARAMETERS: Simplified (token management moved to
  Headroom Management)

The following sections from v1.1 are REMOVED or CONSOLIDATED:
- MINI PROJECT MAP: Consolidated into PROJECT IDENTIFICATION (Horizon
  View) and PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
- COMPLETED WORK: Renamed to PRIOR SESSION SUMMARY
- END-OF-SESSION FILES FROM SOURCE CHAT: Consolidated into PRIOR
  SESSION SUMMARY (artifacts listed there)
- OPEN ITEMS: Consolidated into SESSION FOCUS (what was NOT done) and
  HEADROOM MANAGEMENT (priority ordering)
- IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS: Consolidated into SESSION FOCUS
- FILES TO REFERENCE: Renamed and restructured as MATERIALS REQUIRED
- SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Split between BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS (stable)
  and CONSTRAINTS AND PARAMETERS (session-specific)
- QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS AT SESSION START: Folded into alignment turn
  protocol (the AI generates these proactively)
- NEXT SESSION QUICK-START: Removed (the Bootstrap itself serves this
  function; the quick-start copy-paste prompt was redundant)

ADAPTATION GUIDANCE:

Not every section is needed for every project or session. The template
is designed to be comprehensive for complex projects; simpler projects
may omit or compress sections as appropriate. The following sections
should never be omitted:
- MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
- PROJECT IDENTIFICATION
- PRIOR SESSION SUMMARY
- SESSION FOCUS
- DYNAMIC STATE — RESPONSE INDEX CONTINUITY
- SESSION REQUIREMENTS

The following may be compressed or omitted for simple sessions:
- HEADROOM MANAGEMENT (if session complexity is LOW)
- BEHAVIORAL REMINDERS (if no drift-prone behaviors apply)
- PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA (if single-phase project)
- NOTEBOOK CONNECTIVITY within MATERIALS (if not using notebooks)
