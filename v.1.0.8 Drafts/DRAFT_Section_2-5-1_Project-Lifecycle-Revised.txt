2.5.1 Project Lifecycle (Macro Cycle)
-------------------------------------

The Project Lifecycle spans the entire arc of a project from conception
through completion. This is the strategic level — where objectives are
defined, foundations are built, and success is ultimately measured.

Temporal Scope: Days to months, depending on project complexity.

Key Question: "Where is this project in its overall journey?"

THE PROJECT RHYTHM — SINE WAVE MODEL:

A useful mental model for the project lifecycle is a sine wave. The
rhythm of a project alternates between two modes:

Peaks represent active phase work — high-output execution sessions where
deliverables are produced, problems are solved, and the project advances
toward its objectives.

Zero-crossings represent transition work — planning, scoping, protocol
development, and consolidation sessions where the project pauses active
execution to prepare for the next phase.

The first zero-crossing is rooting (Phase 0). It occurs before the first
peak — the project establishes its foundation before any execution begins.
Subsequent zero-crossings are phase transitions, where the project
consolidates completed work and prepares for the next execution phase.

This model sets expectations: transition sessions feel different from
execution sessions. They are planning-heavy and execution-light. This is
by design, not a sign of stalled progress.

PHASES:

Phase 0 — Rooting. Every project begins with rooting: the deliberate
process of establishing the project's foundation before execution begins.
Rooting is not optional, and it is not a formality. It is the most
consequential phase of the project because everything that follows depends
on the quality of the foundation built here.

If rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions. This is the nervous
system of the project — the governance infrastructure that enables
coherent multi-session execution. Rushing rooting to begin "real work"
is the most common and most costly mistake in AI-assisted project
management.

Rooting produces two foundational outputs:

1. The Project Guide — the authoritative document defining the project's
   identity, scope, deliverables, execution plan, and success criteria
   (see Section 5.1).

2. The Base Phase Protocol — the behavioral governance document that
   tells the AI how to conduct work during the first execution phase
   (see Section 5.2).

The rooting process is collaborative, not mechanical. It involves
substantive dialogue — typically 10 to 20 exchanges — where the AI
probes assumptions, surfaces gaps, and proposes alternatives while the
user engages thoughtfully and raises concerns. This is design work, not
form completion.

THE ROOTING PROCESS:

1. ESTABLISH CONTEXT. The user uploads this manual to a new project
   (or the AI is otherwise oriented to the AIPM framework). The user
   describes what they want to accomplish in broad terms.

2. DEFINE THE DESTINATION. Before mapping the journey, clarify where
   it ends. What are the deliverables? What form will they take? What
   does success look like? Knowing the end helps discern the means and
   the process. If the end-result format is unknown, note it explicitly
   as an open item for resolution — do not leave it implicitly undefined.

3. DETERMINE SCOPE AND APPROACH. Working backward from the destination:
   - What objectives must be met?
   - What methodological approach fits the work?
   - What constraints apply (timeline, resources, expertise)?
   - What dependencies exist?

4. STRUCTURE THE PHASES. Group objectives into discrete phases with
   clear boundaries. For each phase, define:
   - What it aims to accomplish
   - What it produces (deliverables or intermediate outputs)
   - What it requires (inputs, tools, context)
   - Exit criteria (how do we know the phase is complete?)
   - Dependencies on prior phases

5. IDENTIFY TEMPLATES AND TOOLS. Based on the project structure:
   - What templates are needed? (Known now, or anticipated for later?)
   - What tools will be used? (Notebook connectivity, specialized
     software, external validators?)
   - What recurring patterns apply? (Research cycles, review cycles,
     drafting cycles?)

6. PRODUCE THE PROJECT GUIDE. The AI drafts the Project Guide
   incorporating all decisions from steps 1-5. The user reviews,
   revises, and approves.

7. PRODUCE THE BASE PHASE PROTOCOL. The AI drafts the Phase Protocol
   for Phase 1 (the first execution phase), drawing from:
   - Layer 1: AIPM framework behaviors (from this manual)
   - Layer 2: Methodology appropriate to the project type
   - Layer 3: Project-specific context from the rooting conversation
   The user reviews, revises, and approves.

8. PREPARE FOR EXECUTION. The rooting session (or final rooting session,
   if rooting spans multiple sessions) generates a Bootstrap for the
   first execution session. This Bootstrap references the Phase Protocol
   as a mandatory first-action review item.

EXIT CRITERIA FOR PHASE 0:
- Project Guide exists and is approved
- Base Phase Protocol exists and is approved
- Phase structure is defined with clear boundaries
- First execution phase scope and exit criteria are established
- Bootstrap for first execution session is generated
- All foundational decisions are documented

USER ACTION — ROOTING READINESS:

Before entering rooting, the user should be able to answer:
- "What am I trying to accomplish?" (even if the answer is broad)
- "Why does this matter?" (motivation clarifies priorities)
- "What does 'done' look like?" (even approximately)

If the user cannot answer these questions, an Exploration Session may be
more appropriate than formal rooting. Exploration Sessions are
unstructured conversations that help clarify thinking before committing
to a project structure.

Cross-reference: Section 1.4.5 provides the Project Readiness Assessment.
Section 5.1 details the Project Guide. Section 5.2 details the Phase
Protocol. Section 4.3.5 covers phase transitions.

Execution Phases (Phases 1 through N). The bulk of project work, spanning
multiple sessions per phase and potentially multiple phases per project.
Progress is measured against defined milestones and phase exit criteria.
The sine wave rhythm continues: execution peaks followed by transition
zero-crossings as the project advances through its phase structure.

Each execution phase operates under its Phase Protocol, which may be
redrafted at phase transitions if behaviors need to change. The Project
Roadmap (TPL-010) tracks phase completion and upcoming work.

Completion. Final deliverables produced, reviewed, and accepted. Project
artifacts archived for future reference. Lessons captured for process
improvement. The Project Closure Report (TPL-022) formalizes the
completion process.

Templates Operating at This Level:
- TPL-001: Project Initiation Form (structures the rooting process)
- TPL-0XX: Phase Protocol Template (governs phase-level behaviors)
- TPL-007: Re-Entry Checklist (resuming after extended absence)
- TPL-010: Project Roadmap (tracking overall progress)
- TPL-022: Project Closure Report (formal project completion)

Common Macro-Level Failures:
- Rushing or skipping rooting, leading to weak project foundations
- Scope creep undetected until late stages
- Insufficient upfront definition leading to repeated pivots
- Loss of project thread across extended timelines
- Completion criteria never clarified, causing indefinite extension
- Phase transitions treated as interruptions rather than essential
  consolidation points
