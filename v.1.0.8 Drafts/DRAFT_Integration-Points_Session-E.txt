================================================================================
DRAFT — INTEGRATION POINTS FOR SESSION E CONTENT
================================================================================
Target:     Multiple existing sections and prior drafts in GOV-AIPM
Drafted:    Session 037
Categories: 10 (Phase Transitions), 11 (Operational Refinements)
            — integration weave
Status:     DRAFT — pending user review
================================================================================

These are targeted insertions and modifications that create the
cross-reference web connecting Session E content to the rest of the
manual and to prior session drafts.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 1: Section 2.7.3 Phase Transition Orientation Duty
Location: Existing Section 2.7.3 (lines 1239-1264 in v1.0.7)
Action: ADD reference to the 8-step process
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD after the existing "AI Behaviors" list (after approximately
line 1258):

The full phase transition process — an 8-step protocol covering
assessment, consolidation, synthesis, deferred item review, scope
definition, Phase Protocol evaluation, rolling record updates, and
artifact generation — is specified in Section 4.3.5.2. The AI leads
this process, presenting each step's outputs for user review.

REPLACE the existing cross-reference line (line 1264):

Cross-reference: Section 4.3.5 provides the full Phase Transition
Protocol including the 8-step process and the husk-vs-coconut
synthesis principle.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 2: Section 2.7 AI Coordinator Duties — Summary
Location: Section 2.7.8 "What Users Should Expect" (lines 1374-1398)
Action: ADD Conflict Resolution awareness to the expectation list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to the existing expectation list (after "The AI will prompt for
decision documentation", approximately line 1386):

- The AI will flag conflicts between protocol behaviors and project
  objectives, proposing resolution options rather than silently
  deviating or rigidly adhering

ADD to the sentence list in the explanation paragraph:

If the AI follows a protocol rigidly when it clearly harms the
project's objectives, or deviates from protocol without flagging the
deviation, the Conflict Resolution Protocol (Section 4.5) has not been
properly adopted.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 3: Section 5.2.5 Phase Protocol Lifecycle
Location: Session A draft Section 5.2.5, "TRANSITION" block
Action: ADD cross-reference to the 8-step process
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD at the end of the TRANSITION block (after "redraft is an
intentional decision made during the phase transition, not assumed"):

The phase transition process (Section 4.3.5.2) specifies the full
8-step protocol that includes Phase Protocol evaluation as Step 6.
The evaluation questions — behavioral change needs, methodology shifts,
Layer 3 updates, addendum accumulation, and behavioral lessons — are
executed as part of this structured transition process.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 4: Section 4.3.1 Session Initiation
Location: Session B draft Section 4.3.1 (continuation sequence)
Action: VERIFY Phase Protocol evaluation reference
------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERIFICATION: Session B's Section 4.3.1 already includes Phase Protocol
review as the mandatory first action in the continuation sequence
(Step 2). No additional modification needed for Session E content.

However, Session B's Section 4.3.1 notes that the Branch Sessions
sequence references "Section [Branch Management]" — this should be
updated to "Section 12.3" per Session D's branch management draft.

UPDATE in the Branch Sessions sequence:

  1. User provides Branch Startup File (see Section 12.3)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 5: Session D Backlog Register — Scope Monitoring
         Placeholder Resolution
Location: Session D draft Section 5.9.4 and 5.9.7
Action: RESOLVE placeholder references to Scope Monitoring Duty
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Session D's Backlog Register enhancement includes placeholder
references to the Scope Monitoring Duty:

In Section 5.9.4 (enhanced AI Coordinator Role):
REPLACE: "(Scope Monitoring Duty)" or similar placeholder
WITH: "(Section 2.7.2)"

In Section 5.9.7 (Insight Capture Protocol):
REPLACE: "The AI's Scope Monitoring Duty (Section [Session E
placeholder])"
WITH: "The AI's Scope Monitoring Duty (Section 2.7.2)"

REPLACE: "per Section [Scope Monitoring]"
WITH: "per Section 2.7.2"


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 6: Section 2.2.3 Internal Cross-Reference
Location: Session E draft Section 2.2.3 enhancement
Action: NOTE for Session G — resolve "Section 3.X" placeholder
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Session E Section 2.2.3 enhancement references "Section 3.X
(Instruction Chain Interpretation)" with a placeholder number. During
Session G integration:

REPLACE: "Section 3.X"
WITH: "Section 3.8" (or final number if Section 3 is reorganized)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 7: Phase Protocol Template — Layer 1 Verification
Location: Session A draft Templates (Phase Protocol Template, Part A)
Action: VERIFY Layer 1 items match Session E specifications
------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERIFICATION: Session A's Phase Protocol Template (Part A — AIPM
Framework Behaviors) lists:

- Conflict resolution protocol (stop, flag, explain, propose, await,
  document)
- Instruction chain interpretation rules (sequential with alignment
  checkpoints)

Both now have full specifications:
- Conflict Resolution → Section 4.5 (this session)
- Instruction Chain → Section 3.8 (this session)

No template modification needed — the Layer 1 references are already
accurate. Session G should verify the cross-reference section numbers
are correct in the template.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION POINT 8: Table of Contents
Location: Lines 1-160 (TOC in v1.0.7)
Action: ADD new sections to TOC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD to Section 3 TOC entries (after 3.7):
    3.8 Instruction Chain Interpretation

ADD to Section 4 TOC entries (after 4.4, accounting for Session C's
CTP placement):
    4.5 Conflict Resolution Protocol

NOTE: Section numbering for the existing 4.4+ content will depend on
Session G's renumbering decisions. The TOC additions here assume:
- 4.4 = Connector Transparency Protocol (Session C)
- 4.5 = Conflict Resolution Protocol (this session)

INTEGRATION NOTES
================================================================================

ORDERING:
These integration points should be applied during Session G along with
all integration points from Sessions A-D. They are non-destructive
additions except where explicitly noted as replacements.

Integration Point 5 resolves placeholders created in Session D — it
should be applied after Session D's content is integrated.

Integration Point 6 is a self-referential note about this session's own
drafts — it reminds Session G to resolve the cross-reference.

SESSION E DRAFT FILE CROSS-REFERENCE:
