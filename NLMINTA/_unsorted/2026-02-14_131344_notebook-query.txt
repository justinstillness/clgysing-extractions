**Thesis Genesis from Library Survey (Stage TD-1)**

**Prior Discussion and Status**
"Thesis Genesis" (Stage TD-1) is defined as the process where the AI surveys the library or corpus to propose thesis directions, thematic gaps, or unexplored intersections [1]. It is distinct from the user providing a thesis idea. As of the Phase 3 transition (Session 021), this stage was classified as **"NOT TESTED"** requiring dedicated testing [2].

The discussion established that NotebookLM (NLM) could potentially query a notebook loaded with a **D1 Library** (first-degree extraction products) or a **raw corpus** to identify promising thesis directions [3]. This capability serves as "Entry Point B" for the Top-Down Workflow, automating the brainstorming phase [1].

**Finding F53: Thesis Generation Quality**
While TD-1 was not formally validated as a standalone workflow, **Finding F53** (documented in Session 011) provided the preliminary proof of concept.

*   **What it was:** F53 ("NLM Thesis Generation Quality Is High at Degree-One Depth") resulted from a preparatory step for Test 2c (Thesis-Lens Extraction). NLM was queried to generate a master thesis and sub-theses from the **SP03 Repositories** notebook (containing 99 extracted concepts) [4].
*   **What it showed:** NLM successfully produced a **coherent master thesis** (a single declarative claim linking parasitic/symbiotic systems, knowledge paths, and intimacies) and **7 logically structured sub-theses** [4].
*   **Implications:**
    *   The output demonstrated clear **hierarchical dependency** (sub-theses supporting the master) and accurate representation of the source's argumentative architecture [4].
    *   It proved NLM can synthesize a coherent argumentative framework from extraction products (Degree 1 data) without human intervention [5].
    *   This validated the viability of Phase 3 (Thesis Architecture), suggesting that iterative, threaded queries could build deeper thesis trees [6].

**Query Design Considerations for TD-1 Testing**
The "LibForge Workflow Map" outlines specific query design variables and questions to be addressed during future TD-1 testing [2]:

1.  **Source Material Type:** Testing must distinguish between generating theses from a **raw corpus** versus a **D1 Library** (organized extraction output) to determine which yields higher quality candidates [2].
2.  **Candidate Quality:** Queries must test NLM's ability to distinguish between **thesis-worthy** insights and **trivial observations** [2].
3.  **Coherence:** Can NLM identify "coherent thesis candidates" rather than just topic lists? [2].
4.  **Gap Identification:** The design includes using NLM to identify **thematic gaps** or unexplored intersections as triggers for thesis genesis [2].
