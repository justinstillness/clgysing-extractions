Based on the sources, here is the test design for **HS-1 (Argument Block Creation)**, also referred to as **Concept-to-Thesis Mapping**:

**Test Design: HS-1 (Argument Block Creation)**

*   **Purpose:** To validate whether NotebookLM can function as a "handshake" engine that bridges the **Top-Down** workflow (Thesis Architecture) and **Bottom-Up** workflow (Extraction). Specifically, the test determines if NLM can accurately identify which concepts, terms, and relationship data from a **D1 Library** best support a specific **Thesis String** [1, 2].
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Input:** Select a specific **Thesis String** (generated during Stage TD-2/Epistemic Regress) [1, 3].
    2.  **Query:** Query a notebook containing a **D1 Library** (extracted concepts) using the thesis string as a probe [2].
    3.  **Task:** Instruct NLM to identify concepts that support the thesis, generate relationship mappings between the concepts and the thesis, and identify the strongest evidence [2, 3].
    4.  **Comparison:** Compare NLM's automated mapping against a manual mapping performed by Claude to assess fidelity and relevance [4, 5].
*   **Required Notebooks:**
    *   A notebook containing a **D1 (First Degree) Library**, such as the **SP03 Repositories** or **SP07 D1 output** (which contain extracted concepts, terms, and relationships) [4, 6].
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   NLM must successfully identify concepts from the D1 library that best support the given thesis string [4].
    *   NLM must generate valid relationship mappings (e.g., *supports*, *evidences*, *nuances*) between the concepts and the thesis string [4].
    *   The output must be usable as a semantic blueprint (ArgBlock) for drafting [2].
*   **Relation to ArgBlock Creation in LibForge:**
    *   HS-1 **is** the ArgBlock creation stage. An **ArgBlock** (Argument Block) is the composite unit used for drafting, consisting of a thesis string, linked concept packets, cross-references, and treatment notes [2, 7].
    *   This test validates the "Handshake" mechanism where the **Top-Down** architecture (Blueprint) and **Bottom-Up** extraction (Ore) converge to build the "House" (Prose) [8, 9].
    *   It operationalizes the **Semantic Handshake** (Master List Item #16) by using thesis strings to query the repository for assets [10].
