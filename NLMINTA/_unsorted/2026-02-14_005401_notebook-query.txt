Based on the NLMINTA Phase 2 and 3 findings and specifications, here are the details on the Thesis-Lens (TL) extraction types, the model-as-source concept, and the requirements for testing them.\
\
### TL-B and TL-C: Definitions and Differences\
\
**TL-B (Current Event Analysis)** and **TL-C (Corpus Expansion)** are advanced applications of the Thesis-Lens methodology theorized during Phase 3 but not yet formally validated. They share the same query structure as TL-A but differ fundamentally in the relationship between the **Lens** (the framework) and the **Data** (the target).\
\
*   **TL-B: Current Event Analysis**\
    *   **Purpose:** To generate interpretive analysis of real-world events through a specific framework.\
    *   **The Lens:** An established framework or thesis (e.g., the Agenda 47 master thesis).\
    *   **The Data:** Current news articles, event reports, or live phenomena.\
    *   **The Output:** Interpretive content explaining *how* the event manifests the framework's mechanics (e.g., \"How does this news event demonstrate the 'Villain as Feature' dynamic?\").\
    *   **Use Case:** Generating \"Agenda 47 Explains\" articles where the model interprets the news [1].\
\
*   **TL-C: Corpus Expansion**\
    *   **Purpose:** To expand the Cultology corpus itself by testing the framework against new information to find gaps or extensions.\
    *   **The Lens:** A mature, comprehensive framework.\
    *   **The Data:** New research, supplementary academic material, or external models.\
    *   **The Output:** Gap identification, framework extensions, and new thesis strings.\
    *   **Use Case:** Running the established model against a new book (e.g., by Lifton or Zimbardo) to identify what the new source *adds* to or *challenges* in the existing framework [2].\
\
**Difference from TL-A (Analytical Extraction):**\
*   **TL-A** (Validated in Session 021) focuses on **extraction**. It takes *existing* library data and re-extracts it through a lens to find evidence that supports a specific thesis [3].\
*   **TL-B** focuses on **interpretation**. It applies the lens to *external events* to generate new analytical content.\
*   **TL-C** focuses on **growth**. It applies the lens to *new research* to expand the framework itself [4].\
\
### The Model-as-Source Concept\
\
The **Model-as-Source** concept (Variation B in the TL-A Spec) is a method for providing the \"Lens\" to NotebookLM. Instead of pasting a 300-word summary of the model into the query text (as done in TL-A validation), you upload the **full analytical model or treatise as a dedicated text source** in the notebook [5].\
\
*   **Semantic Resonance:** This relates to the \"Semantic Resonance Model\" [6]. A proprietary framework (like Cultology) operates on a \"frequency\" that standard LLM training (Layer 2 knowledge) may not recognize. By uploading the full model as a source, you create a \"Modulating Container\" that explicitly bridges the proprietary concepts to the target data [7].\
*   **Benefit:** It allows NLM to reference the model much more deeply than a prompt allows, accessing specific definitions, nuances, and mechanisms defined in the source document.\
*   **R< 2026/02/14 00:54:30.000797228  length=1536 from=8513 to=10048
isk:** NLM might blend the model and the data in its output rather than keeping them distinct (e.g., attributing a model concept to the data source) [5].\
\
### Notebook Setup for Testing\
\
Testing these applications requires specific notebook configurations to distinguish the \"Lens\" from the \"Data.\"\
\
**For TL-B Testing (Current Events):**\
1.  **Lens Source:** Upload a document containing the **Agenda 47 Thesis** or **Cultology Framework** (either as a Note or a Source file).\
2.  **Data Sources:** Upload PDF/Text versions of **current news articles** or event summaries (e.g., 3...5 articles on a specific topic).\
3.  **Query:** Instruct NLM to \"Analyze [News Source] through the lens of [Thesis Source]...\" [1].\
\
**For TL-C Testing (Corpus Expansion):**\
1.  **Lens Source:** Upload the most mature **Cultology Framework** document available.\
2.  **Data Sources:** Upload a **new research text** or supplementary material that is *not* currently part of the core corpus (e.g., a book not yet integrated).\
3.  **Query:** Instruct NLM to \"Identify gaps, extensions, or challenges to the [Framework Source] based on the evidence in [New Research Source]...\" [2].\
\
**Note:** Unlike TL-A, which was validated using a query-based lens on existing data, TL-B and TL-C likely require the **Model-as-Source** approach to handle the complexity of bridging the framework to completely external or new material [5].
