File Class:     INSIGHT

================================================================================
INSIGHT 1: Project-Specific Automation Tool Calls
================================================================================

During alpha phase, when project rooting is complete and organizational
frameworks are committed, it may be possible to create a single custom
tool call per project that handles file organization automatically.

Concept: During project rooting phase, define the extraction/organization
taxonomy. Build that taxonomy into a dedicated tool call so that all
subsequent extraction outputs are automatically routed to correct locations
without per-file manual organization or documentation overhead.

Key principle: If the organization framework is pre-committed, documenting
individual file moves becomes unnecessary — the system handles it, and
the user can always review the repo directly.

Status: Future alpha consideration. Requires AWSNBLM branch discussion
on feasibility of project-scoped Chronicler extensions.

INSIGHT 2: Query Archaeology — Extracting Test Queries from SeraphRecorder
================================================================================

Problem: Many NLMINTA testing sessions used specific query formulations
and chat_configure prompts that were NOT explicitly documented in the
chat transcript (pre-Connector Transparency Protocol). This means the
actual query text that produced specific outputs is trapped in the
SeraphRecorder extraction files, not in session logs.

Need: When NLMINTA testing concludes and we want to standardize queries
for production use, we need to recover those query formulations.

Proposed solutions (in order of efficiency):
1. SeraphRecorder files likely contain the query text — extract and index
2. Cross-link Claude chat IDs (if embedded in tool calls) with file
   timestamps to map files to sessions
3. Upload extraction files to NotebookLM and query for query patterns
   (lighter token cost than Claude analysis)

Key question: What metadata does SeraphRecorder embed in extraction files?
If chat ID or session context is present, automated cross-linking is feasible.

Status: Deferred to AWSNBLM branch for investigation. Record for future
methodology standardization phase.

================================================================================
INSIGHT 3: Branch-Specific Tagging System
================================================================================

Current problem: 5 different branches all use Majeston, creating mixed
extraction outputs in a single _untagged folder. No way to distinguish
which branch generated which file without manual inspection.

Proposed solution (two tiers):

Tier 1 (Minimum viable): Branch naming conventions enforced. Claude
understands branch name is a critical organizational component, not just
a label. Session bootstraps include branch tag. Manual tagging at session
start.

Tier 2 (Ideal): Embed branch tag directly in the Majeston/Chronicler
tool call itself. When a session boots, it must provide a branch tag
to use the tool. SeraphRecorder captures the tag and routes files to
branch-specific _untagged folders automatically.

Implementation path: Discuss in AWSNBLM branch. May require tool-level
modification or wrapper script.

Status: Active — user moving to implement in AWSNBLM thread.
