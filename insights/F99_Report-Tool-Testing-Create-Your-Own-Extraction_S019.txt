F99: REPORT TOOL TESTING — CREATE YOUR OWN AS EXTRACTION TOOL
================================================================================
Session:    019 NLMINTA (Exclusion Test & Report Tools)
Date:       2026-02-13
Test:       J7 — Report Tool Testing
Notebook:   SP03 Repositories (1e03c6b6-247d-4ddd-801d-8e435ac291b9)

================================================================================
TEST DESIGN
================================================================================

Three report types generated on SP03 via studio_create:
- R1: Briefing Doc (default synthesis)
- R2: Create Your Own (extraction-oriented custom prompt)
- R3: Study Guide (educational format)

All three exported to Google Docs via export_artifact:
- R1: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdC7xse7vdHvEbD2PjjN16otiuI_w91dzloYxxmCdvQ
- R2: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10M-nvjzXGWCOO1BLyZozRjA6tHLZUgBnsL-UXtVrbE4
- R3: https://docs.google.com/document/d/183tS4K5jxVrV2_Ly18HMrokAi2HJheBIXybrXD_Wtdo

R2 custom_prompt: "Create a comprehensive concept inventory from all sources.
For every distinct concept, framework, model, or specialized term found in
the sources, provide: (1) the concept title, (2) a direct quote from the
source defining or describing it, (3) a one-sentence compressed summary,
(4) the category it belongs to [...], and (5) related concepts. List every
concept individually — do NOT consolidate or merge related concepts.
Prioritize completeness over brevity."

RESULTS — R2 (CREATE YOUR OWN) vs QUERY-BASED EXTRACTION
================================================================================

| Metric                | Query TX (J6 Run 1) | Report R2 (Create Your Own) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Concept count         | 23                   | ~72                         |
| Categories (of 10)    | 9                    | 10 (all)                    |
| Granularity           | Major concepts       | Atomic decomposition        |
| Format                | JSON                 | Structured Markdown         |
| Quotes preserved      | Yes                  | Yes                         |
| Generation time       | ~30s                 | ~60s                        |
| Output size           | ~3,000 words         | ~5,000+ words               |
| Unique concepts       | —                    | ~45+ not in query results   |

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

F99-A: REPORT TOOL PRODUCES 3X MORE CONCEPTS THAN QUERIES
  The report engine's larger output budget allows dramatically more complete
  extraction. 72 concepts vs 23 from the same source material.

F99-B: ANTI-CONSOLIDATION PROMPTING WORKS
  Explicit instructions to "list every concept individually" and "do NOT
  consolidate" successfully overrode the natural consolidation bias. The
  report decomposed composite frameworks into atomic entries (e.g., Structure
  of Being broken into 5 component entries, Four Intimacies into 4).

F99-C: REPORT OUTPUT IS MARKDOWN, NOT JSON
  Unlike query-based extraction which can output JSON schemas, reports
  produce structured Markdown. For pipeline integration, this requires
  either (a) parsing the Markdown programmatically, or (b) a follow-up
  query to convert to JSON. The Google Docs export pathway enables Claude
  to fetch and process these via google_drive_fetch.

F99-D: DIMINISHING GRANULARITY AT ATOMIC LEVEL
  Some atomic entries are thin (e.g., "Soul" has only its position in the
  hierarchy). This is a natural tradeoff of maximum granularity — the
  deeper you decompose, the less content per entry. For pipeline purposes,
  thin entries can be flagged for merge during D2/D3 processing.

F99-E: REPORT + QUERY IS COMPLEMENTARY, NOT COMPETITIVE
  Optimal extraction pipeline may use BOTH tools:
  - Reports for broad, high-yield initial capture (D1 Stage 1)
  - Queries for targeted gap-fill with explicit exclusion (D1 Stage 2)
  - Reports for synthesis/survey (D2 Stage 2)

F99-F: EXPORT-TO-DOCS PATHWAY VALIDATED
  export_artifact successfully creates Google Docs readable by Claude via
  google_drive_fetch. This creates a viable bridge for moving large report
  outputs into the drafting pipeline without manual copy-paste.

================================================================================
R1 (BRIEFING DOC) ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

The Briefing Doc produced a coherent narrative synthesis (~2,500 words) covering
all major themes. It organized content into logical sections (Core Philosophy,
Central Framework, Civilizational Analysis, Applied Case Study, Methodology).

Utility: Best for SURVEY work — understanding what's in a notebook before
targeted extraction. NOT suitable for granular extraction due to heavy
consolidation and synthesis orientation.

Pipeline role: Pre-Extraction evaluation (PE pass equivalent).

================================================================================
R3 (STUDY GUIDE) STATUS
================================================================================

Exported but not yet analyzed in detail. Study Guide format may be useful
for Six-Stage Argument Framework content generation. Deferred to future
evaluation if pipeline relevance becomes clear.

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

OPTIMAL D1 EXTRACTION PIPELINE (REVISED):

Stage 1: Generate "Create Your Own" report with anti-consolidation prompt
  → Captures broadest concept inventory (~70+ concepts per source package)
  → Export to Google Docs for Claude processing

Stage 2: Parse report into concept list
  → Convert Markdown entries to structured format (JSON or concept packets)
  → Build exclusion list from Stage 1 titles

Stage 3: Run query-based TX pass with explicit exclusion list
  → Gap-fill for concepts the report missed
  → JSON schema output ready for direct pipeline integration

Stage 4: (If Stage 3 yields >3 new concepts) Additional exclusion passes

Expected total yield: 80-90+ concepts per source package (vs ~25 from
queries alone).
