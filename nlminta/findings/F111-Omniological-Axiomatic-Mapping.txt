================================================================================

The TD-2 discovery that different thesis types (mechanistic, prescriptive,
diagnostic, comparative) generate structurally different sub-claim
architectures has implications beyond article organization. It enables
systematic axiomatic floor mapping for the omniological method.

KEY INSIGHT:
By classifying regress outputs by dependency type (definitional, causal,
evidential, structural), axiomatic floors become systematically identifiable
and categorizable. NLM's bedrock detection capability (distinguishing
researchable gaps from metaphysical axioms) directly serves this purpose.

OMNIOLOGICAL APPLICATION:
1. Regress any thesis to its axiomatic floors via TD-2 methodology
2. Classify the floor type (what kind of "given" is being assumed?)
3. Attempt cross-domain resolution: link one domain's axiomatic floor
   to another domain's explanatory framework
4. Continue until absolute foundations are reached
5. At absolute foundation: evaluate which orientation (theistic,
   materialist, etc.) provides deepest regressive power

EXAMPLE (from user's omniological work):
- Materialist axiom: Big Bang as given (cosmological floor)
- Regression attempt: What explains the Big Bang's emergence?
- Fork: Theistic origination vs. multiverse hypothesis
- Multiverse floor: Either eternal initial state (axiomatic given,
  cannot regress further) or some other beginning point
- Theistic explanation: Provides deeper regressive power because it
  can explain non-material attributes (mind, personality, consciousness)
  without reducing them to artifacts of material emanation
- Materialist floor: Cannot regress past the reduction of mind to matter
  without circular reasoning

PRACTICAL VALUE:
The thesis-type classification + NLM bedrock detection creates a
systematized version of what was previously an intuitive omniological
process. Research can now be organized around identified axiomatic floors
and their cross-domain resolution attempts.
