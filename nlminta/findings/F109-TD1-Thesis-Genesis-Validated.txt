FINDING F109: TD-1 (Thesis Genesis from Library Survey) — VALIDATED
================================================================================
Date:           2026-02-14
Session:        022 NLMINTA (Top-Down LibForge Testing)
Stage:          TD-1 (Top-Down Workflow, Stage 1: Thesis Genesis)
Status:         PRODUCTION-VIABLE

================================================================================
TEST SUMMARY
================================================================================

Test A: D1 Library Survey (SP03 Repositories, 4 sources, 99 concepts)
Test B: Raw Corpus Survey (CLGYSING Source Pkgs, 15 raw sources)

Both tests used identical structured query template requesting:
- Thesis statements (declarative claims, not topic lists)
- Thesis typing (MECHANISTIC / COMPARATIVE / DIAGNOSTIC / PRESCRIPTIVE)
- Evidence base with corpus citations
- Gap flags (missing material for full argumentation)
- Self-assessment (THESIS-WORTHY vs. OBSERVATIONAL)
- Unexplored intersections and thematic gaps

================================================================================
RESULTS
================================================================================

Test A (D1 Library): 9 thesis candidates, 2 unexplored intersections, 2 gaps
Test B (Raw Corpus): 10 thesis candidates, 2 unexplored intersections, 3 gaps

QUALITY MARKERS:
- Declarative thesis statements (not questions/topics): PASS both tests
- Thesis typing applied consistently: PASS both tests
- Evidence citation to specific corpus content: PASS both tests
- Gap flags identify genuinely missing material: PASS both tests
- Self-assessment discriminates thesis-worthy from observational:
  PASS both (Test A: 7/9 thesis-worthy, 2 observational with defensible flags;
  Test B: 8/10 thesis-worthy, 2 observational with defensible flags)
- Unexplored intersections show genuine synthesis: PASS both tests
- Thematic gaps are actionable: Test B stronger than Test A

COMPARATIVE FINDING:
- D1 library produces more focused, framework-aligned thesis candidates
- Raw corpus surfaces wider conceptual territory including economics, law,
  governance, and applied mechanisms not visible in D1 library
- Both entry points are strategically useful for different purposes:
  D1 for framework-aligned work, raw for discovery/exploration

QUERY TEMPLATE (Production-Ready)
================================================================================

TASK: Thesis Genesis from Library Survey

You are surveying this library of [extracted concepts / raw source materials]
to identify thesis candidates — specific, arguable claims that could anchor
a sustained analytical essay or article series. Do NOT produce a topic list
or summary of contents.

For each thesis candidate you identify:

1. THESIS STATEMENT: A single declarative claim (not a question, not a topic)
2. THESIS TYPE: Classify as one of:
   - MECHANISTIC (explains how something works)
   - COMPARATIVE (argues one thing differs from/relates to another)
   - DIAGNOSTIC (identifies a problem or pathology)
   - PRESCRIPTIVE (argues for a solution or approach)
3. EVIDENCE BASE: Which specific concepts from the library support this thesis?
4. GAP FLAG: What is NOT in the library that would need to be developed?
5. THESIS QUALITY SELF-ASSESSMENT: THESIS-WORTHY or OBSERVATIONAL

Additionally, after listing individual candidates, identify:
- UNEXPLORED INTERSECTIONS
- THEMATIC GAPS

Aim for 8-12 thesis candidates.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

TD-1 is validated and production-ready. Strategic guidance:
- Use D1 library survey for framework-aligned thesis generation
- Use raw corpus survey for full conceptual terrain discovery
- Query template above is replicable across notebooks and projects
