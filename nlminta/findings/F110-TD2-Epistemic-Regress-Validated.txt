FINDING F110: TD-2 (Hybrid Epistemic Regress) — VALIDATED
================================================================================
Date:           2026-02-14
Session:        022 NLMINTA (Top-Down LibForge Testing)
Stage:          TD-2 (Top-Down Workflow, Stage 2: Thesis Tree Development)
Status:         PRODUCTION-VIABLE

================================================================================
TEST SUMMARY
================================================================================

Target: CLGYSING Source Pkgs (cce3b796, 15 raw sources)

Test 1: Mechanistic thesis regress (Degrees 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3)
  Thesis: "Intellectual intimacy functions as the critical immune system
  for all human relationships..."
  - Degree 0->1: 7 thesis strings (4 critical path, 3 supporting)
  - Degree 1->2: 6 thesis strings (3 critical path, 3 supporting) + 1 gap
  - Degree 2->3: 6 thesis strings via threading (2 high novelty,
    1 moderate, 3 convergent) + 2 bedrock flags

Test 2: Prescriptive thesis regress (Degree 0 -> 1)
  Thesis: "The transition from parasitic to symbiotic civilization requires
  Triadic Oversight..."
  - Degree 0->1: 7 thesis strings (4 critical path, 3 supporting)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. HIERARCHICAL LOGIC IS SOUND
   Each degree genuinely answers "what must be true" — not restatement
   of parent claims. Real logical decomposition across all tested degrees.

2. CRITICAL PATH vs. SUPPORTING DISCRIMINATION
   NLM makes defensible calls. Examples:
   - Four Intimacies as integrated system: correctly CRITICAL PATH
   - Truth as order-making force: correctly SUPPORTING (metaphysical
     strengthening, not logically necessary)
   - False Symbiosis: correctly SUPPORTING (explains resilience, not
     core mechanism)

3. EVIDENCE STRENGTH ASSESSMENT IS HONEST
   Moderate ratings include genuine reasons (e.g., "link between trauma
   and intellectual intimacy specifically is implicit rather than explicit").
   Not blanket STRONG ratings.

4. THREADING ENABLES DEGREE 3 CONTINUATION
   conversation_id parameter allows NLM to build on prior regress output.
   NLM selected appropriate critical-path claims to deepen and maintained
   logical continuity with prior degrees.

5. DEPTH CEILING ANALYSIS
   - Degrees 0-2: High quality, high novelty (NLM autonomous)
   - Degree 3: ~33% high novelty, ~50% convergent (NLM hybrid with
     human curation)
   - Degree 4+: Likely convergence/repetition (human/Claude takes over)

6. BEDROCK DETECTION
   NLM correctly distinguishes between:
   - Researchable gaps (more data would help)
   - Axiomatic foundations (metaphysical premises of the framework)
   Example: "truth as entrainment mechanism" flagged as metaphysical
   axiom, not researchable gap. Sophisticated distinction.

7. THESIS TYPE AFFECTS REGRESS STRUCTURE
   Mechanistic thesis -> sub-claims are predominantly definitional and
   causal (chains of causation, deep and narrow)
   Prescriptive thesis -> sub-claims are structural, pragmatic, and
   teleological (design requirements, wide and networked)
   Implication: Different thesis types generate different article
   architectures. Interpretation should be thesis-type-aware.

QUERY TEMPLATE (Production-Ready)
================================================================================

TASK: Epistemic Regress — Degree [N] to Degree [N+1]

[DEGREE N THESIS STRING]:
"[Thesis being regressed]"

For this claim to hold, what must be true? Identify the necessary
supporting claims (Degree [N+1] thesis strings). For each:

1. THESIS STRING: A single declarative supporting claim
2. DEPENDENCY TYPE: DEFINITIONAL / CAUSAL / EVIDENTIAL / STRUCTURAL
3. EVIDENCE IN CORPUS: What specific content supports this?
4. EVIDENCE STRENGTH: STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK with brief citation
5. CRITICAL PATH (master thesis fails without it) or SUPPORTING?

[For Degree 3+, add:]
6. NOVELTY CHECK: Genuinely new ground, or convergent with Degrees 1-2?

Flag any point where the corpus runs out of supporting material —
these are bedrock assumptions or genuine research gaps.

Aim for 5-8 thesis strings per degree.

THREADING GUIDANCE:
- Use conversation_id for Degree 2+ to maintain regress continuity
- If threading errors, retry without conversation_id (NLM sometimes
  rejects threading on retry)
- At Degree 3+, explicitly ask NLM to select critical-path claims
  from prior degree for deepening

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
================================================================================

1. TD-1 to survey corpus -> identify thesis candidates
2. Select thesis -> TD-2 Degree 0->1 regress (autonomous)
3. Select critical path D1 claims -> Degree 1->2 (autonomous)
4. Select critical path D2 claims -> Degree 2->3 (threading, hybrid)
5. Human/Claude review D3 output: curate high-novelty, discard convergent
6. Human/Claude push to D4+ where genuine philosophical extension needed
7. Gap flags from regress become extraction priorities
