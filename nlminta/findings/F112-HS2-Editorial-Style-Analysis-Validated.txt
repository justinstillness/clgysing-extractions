FINDING F112: HS-2 (Editorial/Style Analysis) — VALIDATED
================================================================================
Date:           2026-02-14
Session:        022 NLMINTA (Top-Down LibForge Testing)
Stage:          HS-2 (Handshake Workflow, Stage 2: Editorial Preparation)
Status:         PRODUCTION-VIABLE

================================================================================
TEST SUMMARY
================================================================================

Target: Cultology Series notebook (20326c31, 36 sources)
Two queries: Voice pattern analysis + Treatment pattern analysis

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. VOICE PATTERN RECOGNITION: STRONG
   NLM identified 3 distinctive voice modes with prose-level specificity:
   - Integrative Architect (~50%): definition by negation, em-dash expansion,
     triadic listing, mechanical/spatial metaphors
   - Empathetic Guide (~30%): direct second-person address, process
     transparency, epistemic humility, invitation over instruction
   - Incisive Diagnostician (~20%): reversal hooks, italicized emphasis,
     aphoristic summary, short punchy declarations

   CALIBRATION NOTE: Phase Protocol defines target voice as 40% analytical,
   30% prophetic, 20% personal, 10% polemical. NLM's data-driven analysis
   of actual published content shows different proportions and more
   descriptively precise categories. This discrepancy is itself valuable —
   it reveals whether published output matches intended voice targets.

2. TREATMENT PATTERN EXTRACTION: STRONG
   Identified specific authorial techniques:
   - Concept introduction: Memetic handle -> semantic rehabilitation ->
     recursive redefinition (spiral staircase in practice)
   - Argument ramp: Provocation -> Diagnosis -> Mechanism -> Theological
     Implication
   - Controversial claim preparation: "Reluctant discoverer" posture
   - Cross-referencing: Fractal linking (micro to macro), forward promises,
     backward anchoring
   - Example preference hierarchy: Mechanical/biological > cultural/mythic
     > historical

3. SIX-STAGE PATTERN OBSERVED IN PRACTICE
   NLM extracted observable six-stage progression from published content:
   1. Hook/Provocation
   2. Reframing (Semantic Rehabilitation)
   3. Mechanism (The Physics)
   4. Diagnosis (The Pathology)
   5. Theological Anchor (The Source)
   6. Symbiotic Solution (The Redemption)
   This is data-driven observation of how the framework actually manifests,
   valuable for calibrating theoretical framework against real output.

4. PRACTICAL VALUE FOR CLGYSING PIPELINE: HIGH
   Output serves as foundation for Editorial and Style Guide (Phase Protocol
   H.2). Single NLM query produces structured starting point requiring
   human validation rather than human generation from scratch.

5. LIMITATION: SOURCE SCOPE
   NLM analyzed all 36 sources including working notes and ChatGPT
   exchanges. For purer published-voice signal, restrict via source_ids
   to published articles only. This is a refinement for production use,
   not a capability limitation.

VOICE PATTERN ANALYSIS:

TASK: Voice Pattern Analysis for Editorial Guide

Analyze the PUBLISHED content in this notebook to identify and document
the author's distinctive voice characteristics.

For each voice mode identified, provide:
1. VOICE MODE NAME and estimated percentage of overall prose
2. DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS (sentence structure, word choice, rhetorical
   moves, tone markers)
3. REPRESENTATIVE PATTERNS (describe specific prose patterns)
4. WHEN DEPLOYED (what triggers this voice mode?)
5. TRANSITION MARKERS (how does the author shift between modes?)

Additionally analyze: sentence structure tendencies, paragraph
architecture, rhetorical question usage, accessibility layering,
reader address patterns.

TREATMENT PATTERN ANALYSIS:

TASK: Treatment Pattern and Terminology Analysis

Analyze the published content to document HOW concepts are introduced
and handled — not what the concepts are, but the authorial technique.

Analyze:
1. CONCEPT INTRODUCTION PATTERNS
2. ARGUMENT ESCALATION PATTERNS
3. CROSS-REFERENCE HANDLING
4. EXAMPLE AND ANALOGY DEPLOYMENT
5. SIX-STAGE ARGUMENT FRAMEWORK OBSERVATION

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

HS-2 is validated and production-viable. For production use:
- Restrict source_ids to published content only for purer voice signal
- Use voice analysis output as foundation for Editorial Guide (H.2)
- Use treatment pattern output as drafting instructions for prose generation
- Validate NLM's observed voice ratios against intended targets to
  calibrate future drafting
