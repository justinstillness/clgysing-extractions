DEVELOPMENT WISHLIST — SESSION 026 ADDENDUM
================================================================================
Date:      2026-02-12
Session:   026
Action:    Append these entries to Development Wishlist after Section 4

Note on numbering: Earlier in S026, W-049 and W-050 were informally
assigned to Caliper Recursion and NLM-to-Repo Ingestion. However, W-050
is already assigned to Indexer Alpha Production Testing. Reassigning:

  W-047: Mobile Transcript Capture
  W-048: EC2 Configuration Backup  
  W-049: Caliper Subdirectory Recursion (was informally W-049, confirmed)
  W-061: NLM-to-Repo Ingestion Tool (was informally W-050, reassigned)

Items W-047 and W-048 were identified in sessions S024-S025.
Items W-049 and W-061 were formalized in session S026 from NLMINTA S016 brief.
Transcript Auto-Archive is folded into W-047 as a stretch goal.

================================================================================
NEW ENTRIES — SECTION 4 (Infrastructure & Maintenance)
================================================================================

W-047: Mobile Transcript Capture
Priority:    P3
Status:      IDEA (S025, formalized S026)

Description:
A solution (bookmarklet, browser extension alternative, or service) to
capture Claude conversation transcripts on mobile devices where Chrome
extensions like Claude Exporter do not work. The Transcript Receiver
(port 8096) was built in S025 as a paste-based workaround, but mobile
copy-paste of full transcripts proved impractical due to UI limitations.

Approaches to evaluate:
- Bookmarklet that extracts conversation DOM and POSTs to receiver
- Mobile browser automation (Shortcuts on iOS)
- Claude API transcript export (if/when available)
- Alternative: accept mobile sessions as lower-fidelity and prioritize
  desktop for transcript-critical work

Stretch: Automate routing of captured transcripts into GitHub repo and
NLM notebooks (originally tracked as separate W-047/auto-archive concept,
folded here as end-to-end pipeline).

W-048: EC2 Configuration Backup
Priority:    P3
Status:      IDEA (S025, formalized S026)

Description:
Periodic snapshot of the /home/ubuntu/ directory structure (scripts,
configs, .env files, service definitions) to GitHub or Google Drive.
Currently, EC2 configuration is not backed up — if the instance is
terminated, all custom scripts and configurations would need to be
rebuilt from session transcripts.

Approach options:
- Chronicler-based: tar + push key directories to repo
- rsync to Google Drive (via rclone)
- Cron job: weekly snapshot to _backups/ in repo
- Selective: only backup changed files (git diff approach)

Excludes: Large binary files, node_modules, auth tokens (security)

================================================================================
NEW ENTRIES — SECTION 3 (Chronicler Enhancements)
================================================================================

W-049: Caliper Subdirectory Recursion
Priority:    P3
Status:      IDEA (S026, from NLMINTA S016 brief)

Description:
Add optional recursive parameter to Caliper's analyze_github_folder tool
to scan all subdirectories and produce a unified inventory report. Currently
requires separate calls per directory.

Implementation: Add recursive flag that walks subdirectories, aggregating
file metrics into a single structured response. Include directory path
in per-file output for disambiguation.

Build estimate: <1 session

================================================================================
NEW ENTRIES — SECTION 7 (File Browser) or NEW SECTION
================================================================================

W-061: NLM-to-Repo Ingestion Tool
Priority:    P3
Status:      IDEA (S026, from NLMINTA S016 brief)

Description:
Cross-service orchestration tool combining Majeston + Chronicler + Caliper
to ingest NotebookLM source content to a repo staging folder with optional
analysis. Claude triggers a single tool call; the pipeline reads NLM
source content, writes it to the repo, and optionally runs Caliper
analysis.

Workflow:
1. Majeston:source_get_content → retrieve raw text
2. Chronicler:write_file → save to repo staging folder
3. (Optional) Caliper:analyze_github_folder → generate metrics

Could be a Conductor workflow (W-100 dependent) or a manual Claude
multi-tool sequence documented as a standard operating procedure.

Build estimate: 1 session (as Conductor workflow) or 0 sessions (as SOP)
