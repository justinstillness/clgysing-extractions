SPECIFICATION — INDEXER: FILE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM
================================================================================
Project:        AWSNBLM (Havona Anvil Suite)
Version:        v0.1 (Provisional — pending alpha/beta validation)
File Class:     SPEC
Created:        2026-02-09
Session:        022

PURPOSE:
The Indexer is the organizational protocol layer for the HA Suite extraction
pipeline. It governs how extraction outputs are named, classified, stored,
tracked, and retrieved across projects, phases, and refinement stages.

Currently a protocol (Claude-side behavior governed by this document).
Will be evaluated for promotion to a dedicated tool if workflow patterns
stabilize and automation warrants it.

STATUS: PROVISIONAL. This specification encodes working principles validated
through design discussion. It awaits alpha/beta testing to confirm structural
decisions. Expect v1.0 after initial production use.

================================================================================
1. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

Six foundational principles govern the Indexer system:

P-1: FILENAME MUST BE SELF-IDENTIFYING

A file's name carries enough metadata to identify it without needing to
check folder location or manifest. The filename is the primary identification
mechanism. A file displaced from its folder should still be identifiable.

P-2: MASTER QUERY MANIFEST

A rolling document logs every extraction query — what was asked, of what
sources, in what session, for what phase/purpose, what it produced, and
where the output lives. This is the authoritative cross-reference index.
The file system is ONE access path; the manifest is the COMPREHENSIVE index.

P-3: DEGREE CLASSIFICATION

Artifacts have a refinement level (D1 through DM). These are finite classes
embedded in filenames and tracked in the manifest. Degree indicates how far
an artifact has progressed through the refinement pipeline.

P-4: FOLDER STRUCTURE SERVES BROWSING, MANIFEST SERVES FINDING

Folders organized by the most common access pattern (project > phase > pass
type). The manifest compensates for the inherent limitations of any single
hierarchy. You don't need to find everything by browsing — the manifest
tells you where things are.

P-5: SESSION FOLDERS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, NOT PRIMARY

Session provenance lives in the filename and manifest. The primary repo
organization is project/phase/type. If a session-centric view is ever
needed, the manifest can generate it.

P-6: SOURCE SCOPE IS FLEXIBLE, NOT FOLDER-LEVEL

Queries may target individual source packages, pairs, or entire notebooks.
Source scope is a filename and manifest attribute, NOT a folder level.
This avoids combinatorial explosion of folders.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:

The system draws from established approaches in:
- Faceted classification (library science) — multiple independent facets
  per item, accessible via any facet
- Digital asset management (DAM) — metadata-rich manifests plus convention-
  based filenames for multi-stage production pipelines
- Laboratory information management (LIMS) — unique IDs, transformation
  logging, provenance chains
- Software build systems — stage identification, build manifests, artifact
  progression through pipelines

The biological analogy: enzymes are classified by function (reaction type)
and numbered by the EC system (class > subclass > sub-subclass > serial).
We need a similar finite typology with systematic numbering.

================================================================================
2. DEGREE CLASSIFICATION (Artifact Refinement Levels)
================================================================================

Every extraction artifact has a refinement degree indicating its position
in the processing pipeline:

DEGREE    LABEL              DESCRIPTION
------    -----              -----------
D1        First Degree       Raw extraction output, direct from query.
                             Unedited, unorganized. The "ore."

D2        Second Degree      Organized, numbered, cleaned within pass type.
                             Duplicate removal, ID assignment, formatting
                             standardized. The "refined material."

D3        Third Degree       Consolidated across source packages.
                             Cross-package merging, gap identification,
                             thematic integration. The "alloy."

DM        Master Degree      Final production artifact. Validated, complete,
                             ready for downstream use (thesis architecture,
                             drafting, etc.). The "finished product."

DEGREE PROGRESSION RULES:

- D1 > D2: Within a single pass type and source scope. Cleaning and numbering.
- D2 > D3: Across source packages within a pass type. Consolidation.
- D3 > DM: Final validation and production-readiness check.
- Not all artifacts progress to DM. Some D1 outputs may be exploratory only.
- Degree progression is LOGGED in the manifest (which D1 files fed into D2, etc.).

DEGREE IN FILENAMES: Embedded as D1, D2, D3, or DM (see Section 4).

================================================================================
3. PASS TYPE REGISTRY
================================================================================

Pass types define WHAT kind of extraction was performed. This is a controlled
vocabulary — new types are added deliberately, not ad hoc.

ESTABLISHED PASS TYPES (from Sessions 007-011 testing):

CODE    FULL NAME                 DESCRIPTION
----    ---------                 -----------
PE      Pre-Extraction            Source evaluation, quality assessment,
                                  readiness check before extraction begins

CE      Concept Extraction        Core concept packets — ideas, frameworks,
                                  arguments from source material

VX      Vocabulary Extraction     Term-centric glossary entries — definitions,
                                  usage context, related terms

TS      Thesis Strings            Declarative claims, argumentative architecture,
                                  evidence chains, logical relationships

TM      Thematic Mapping          Theme identification and clustering across
                                  source material — landscape survey

GL      Glossary                  Consolidated terminology reference
                                  (often a D2/D3 product of VX passes)

EV      Evaluation                Critical analysis — contradictions, gaps,
                                  factual issues, quality assessment

TX      Thematic Extraction       Dedicated extraction by theme (deeper than TM,
                                  produces concept packets organized by theme)

INFRASTRUCTURE PASS TYPES (non-extraction):

CODE    FULL NAME                 DESCRIPTION
----    ---------                 -----------
INF     Infrastructure Query      Pipeline status, configuration queries,
                                  system context gathering

DOC     Documentation Query       Querying session transcripts for historical
                                  context, decision recovery, findings inventory

NEW PASS TYPE PROTOCOL:

When a query type doesn't match existing passes:
1. AI proposes new code (2-3 letter uppercase, semantically clear)
2. AI states: "This query type doesn't match existing passes. I propose:
   [CODE] for [purpose]. Add to registry?"
3. User confirms or suggests alternative
4. AI adds to this registry and notes in session log

================================================================================
4. FILENAME CONVENTION
================================================================================

PRIMARY FORMAT (extraction artifacts):

{PassType}-{SourceScope}-{Degree}-S{Session}.txt

COMPONENTS:

PassType:     2-3 letter code from Pass Type Registry (Section 3)
SourceScope:  Identifies what was queried (see rules below)
Degree:       D1, D2, D3, or DM
Session:      S### (3-digit, zero-padded session number)

SOURCE SCOPE ENCODING:

Single source package:       SP03
Multiple specific packages:  SP03+SP07
All packages in notebook:    ALL
Specific notebook:           NB.{shortname}
                             (e.g., NB.CULT for Cultology Series,
                              NB.HASSAN for Hassan notebook)
Cross-notebook:              XNB.{descriptor}

EXAMPLES:

VX-SP03-D1-S025.txt
  Vocabulary extraction, Source Package 03, raw output, session 25

CE-SP03+SP07-D1-S026.txt
  Concept extraction, two packages combined, raw output, session 26

TM-ALL-D1-S024.txt
  Thematic mapping, all source packages, raw output, session 24

VX-ALL-D3-S030.txt
  Vocabulary consolidated across all packages, third degree, session 30

TS-NB.CULT-D1-S027.txt
  Thesis strings, queried Cultology Series notebook, raw, session 27

CE-MASTER-DM-S040.txt
  Master concept repository, final production artifact, session 40

GL-SP03-D2-S025.txt
  Glossary from SP03, organized and numbered, session 25

PE-SP03-D1-S024.txt
  Pre-extraction evaluation of SP03, raw output, session 24

INF-NB.SESSIONS-D1-S022.txt
  Infrastructure query against sessions notebook, raw, session 22

FILENAME RULES:

- All uppercase for pass type and source scope
- Hyphens separate components (never underscores in primary format)
- Session number always 3 digits (S001, S022, S100)
- .txt extension (plain text, per project convention)
- No spaces in filenames
- Degree is ALWAYS present

SUPPLEMENTAL SUFFIX (optional, for disambiguation):

When multiple files share the same primary name (e.g., two VX passes on
SP03 in the same session), append a sequential letter:

VX-SP03-D1-S025a.txt
VX-SP03-D1-S025b.txt

Or a thematic tag:

VX-SP03-D1-S025-identity.txt
VX-SP03-D1-S025-epistemology.txt

The manifest resolves any remaining ambiguity.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:

- Project folders created when project work begins (not preemptively)
- Phase folders created at phase entry
- Pass type folders created on first use
- Infrastructure/documentation queries stay in _untagged/ or get
  moved to a project-specific _context/ folder if worth preserving

FUTURE PROJECT EXAMPLE:

a47/                          Agenda 47 project
  phase2/
    CE/
    VX/

CROSS-PROJECT ARTIFACTS:

If an artifact spans projects (rare), it lives in the primary project's
tree and the manifest cross-references it.

================================================================================
6. QUERY MANIFEST (Master Index)
================================================================================

The query manifest is the authoritative tracking document for all extraction
queries and their outputs. It is the "finding" mechanism that compensates
for the inherent limits of folder-based browsing.

FORMAT: JSON (machine-readable, queryable, updatable via Chronicler)

LOCATION: /query-manifest.json (repository root)

ENTRY STRUCTURE (per query):

  id:                Sequential query ID (Q001, Q002, etc.)
  timestamp:         When the query was executed
  session:           Which session produced it (S###)
  phase:             LibForge phase context
  project:           Which project this serves
  pass_type:         Pass type code (from registry)
  source_scope:      What was queried (SP03, ALL, NB.CULT, etc.)
  notebook_id:       NLM notebook UUID
  notebook_name:     Human-readable notebook name
  source_ids:        Specific source IDs or "all"
  query_text:        Full query text (or close paraphrase)
  chat_configure:    NLM chat configuration state
  conversation_id:   Threading ID if used
  degree:            Artifact degree (D1, D2, D3, DM)
  output_file:       Path to output file in repo
  output_chars:      Size of output
  item_count:        Number of items extracted
  quality_notes:     Brief quality/completeness assessment
  parent_queries:    IDs of queries this builds on (for D2+)
  child_queries:     IDs of queries that build on this
  status:            active | superseded | archived

MANIFEST METADATA:

  last_updated:          Date of last update
  last_updated_session:  Session number
  total_queries:         Running count
  schema_version:        For future format migrations

MANIFEST MAINTENANCE:

- Updated every time a query is executed and output is organized
- Updated when degree progression occurs (parent/child links)
- Updated when files are moved or reorganized
- The manifest is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for "what do we have"

MANIFEST QUERY PATTERNS (how Claude uses it):

- "What VX passes have been done on SP03?" > filter by pass_type + source_scope
- "What D1 artifacts are ready for D2 consolidation?" > filter by degree
- "What was queried in session 025?" > filter by session
- "Show me the refinement chain for the master glossary" > follow parent/child

================================================================================
7. NLM NOTEBOOK SYNC PROTOCOL
================================================================================

The Havona Anvil Suite NLM notebook (430df618-e337-4971-abaa-6528e96bb1c4)
contains living documentation. When docs change, the notebook must be synced.

SYNC MANIFEST: _docs/NLM-MANIFEST.json (created S022)

SYNC WORKFLOW (when a _docs/ file is updated):

1. COMMIT new version to GitHub via Chronicler:write_file
2. DELETE old source from NLM notebook via Majeston:source_delete
3. ADD updated file to NLM notebook via Majeston:source_add
4. UPDATE NLM-MANIFEST.json with new source_id and session number
5. NOTE sync in session log

SYNC TRIGGERS:

- Any modification to files in _docs/
- Addition of new documentation files
- Version increments on existing docs

BOOTSTRAP ENCODING:

Every bootstrap must include:
- Current NLM-MANIFEST.json state (or pointer to check it)
- Reminder of sync duty when _docs/ files are modified

================================================================================
8. SERAPH ROUTING (Automated Classification)
================================================================================

STATUS: Conceptual. To be developed as pipeline matures.

CURRENT STATE:
SeraphRecorder captures Majeston traffic and deposits timestamped files
in _untagged/. Files contain metadata headers (query text, notebook ID,
timestamp, etc.) but are NOT automatically classified by pass type,
source scope, or degree.

TARGET STATE (incremental):

Phase 1 — Signal String Enhancement:
  SERAPH signal strings already carry some metadata. Extend to include:
  - Pass type code (VX, CE, TS, etc.)
  - Source scope identifier
  - Project context
  This enables approximately 90% automated routing.

Phase 2 — Automated Filing:
  extract.py (or successor) reads enhanced signal strings and:
  - Generates filename per convention (Section 4)
  - Routes to correct project/phase/pass folder
  - Creates manifest entry

Phase 3 — Claude-Assisted Classification:
  For queries that can't be auto-classified (multi-source, cross-phase,
  exploratory), Claude reviews and classifies manually, updating manifest.

TIMELINE: Develops alongside production use. Not blocking current work.

================================================================================
9. EVOLUTIONARY ROADMAP
================================================================================

CURRENT (v0.1 — Protocol):
  - Indexer is a documented protocol
  - Claude follows conventions manually
  - Manifest updated by Claude via Chronicler
  - Folder structure built incrementally

NEAR-TERM (v0.2 — Tested Protocol):
  - Alpha/beta testing with real CLGYSING extraction work
  - Conventions validated or refined based on actual usage
  - Volume reality check (50 files? 500?)
  - Manifest format confirmed

MID-TERM (v1.0 — Mature Protocol):
  - Conventions stabilized
  - SERAPH routing partially automated
  - Manifest maintenance semi-automated
  - Pass type registry comprehensive

LONG-TERM (v2.0 — Dedicated Tool):
  - If workflow patterns stabilize and automation warrants it
  - Indexer becomes a 5th HA Suite tool
  - Orchestration layer: receive extraction > classify > name > route >
    update manifest > update counter
  - Reduces Claude-side behavioral burden to tool calls

PROMOTION CRITERIA (Protocol to Tool):

The Indexer should become a dedicated tool when:
  - The classification logic is stable (no more ad hoc decisions)
  - The same multi-step workflow is executed >20 times manually
  - The manifest update pattern is fully predictable
  - The value of automation exceeds the cost of building/maintaining the tool

================================================================================
10. OPEN QUESTIONS (Alpha/Beta Resolution)
================================================================================

These questions cannot be answered by design alone. They require production
experience to resolve.

Q1: FOLDER DEPTH
    Is project/phase/pass-type enough, or do we need deeper nesting?
    Resolution: Observe during first 50 files organized.

Q2: MANIFEST FORMAT
    Is JSON the right format? Should it be a flat log, structured JSON,
    or something queryable (SQLite)?
    Resolution: Evaluate after manifest reaches approximately 100 entries.

Q3: VOLUME REALITY
    Are we dealing with 50 files per project phase, or 500?
    Resolution: Measure during CLGYSING Phase 2 extraction.

Q4: CONSOLIDATION WORKFLOW
    How does D1 to D2 to D3 actually feel in practice? Are the degree
    boundaries clear, or do we need intermediate steps?
    Resolution: Execute at least one full consolidation chain.

Q5: CROSS-PHASE REUSE
    How often do pass types repeat across phases (e.g., VX in Phase 2
    and again in Phase 5 drafting)?
    Resolution: Track during multi-phase work.

Q6: SESSION-CENTRIC VIEW
    Is the manifest sufficient for session-based retrieval, or do we
    need explicit session folders in the repo?
    Resolution: Evaluate based on actual retrieval patterns.

Q7: SERAPH SIGNAL COMPLETENESS
    Does the current signal string format carry enough metadata for
    90% automated routing, or does it need extension?
    Resolution: Audit signal strings against classification needs.

Q8: UNTAGGED TRIAGE CADENCE
    How often should _untagged/ be triaged — every session, weekly,
    or at phase boundaries?
    Resolution: Observe accumulation rate and urgency.
