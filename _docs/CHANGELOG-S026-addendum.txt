FIXED: Chronicler flush_pipeline tool discovery issue resolved
  - Root cause: flush_pipeline function defined AFTER mcp.run() entry point
    in chronicler.py. FastMCP builds tool manifest before mcp.run() blocks,
    so the tool was never included in the client-facing MCP handshake.
  - Fix: Moved flush_pipeline definition (with import asyncio) above the
    entry point block. Backup created as chronicler.py.bak.flush_move.
  - Verification: grep confirms correct ordering, service restarted clean.
    Fresh session test pending (manifest cached per session).
  - This resolves the "Chronicler tools may not appear in Claude UI"
    known issue for flush_pipeline specifically.

ADDED: Pipeline visualization diagrams
  - _docs/diagrams/core-extraction-pipeline.mermaid
  - _docs/diagrams/pipeline-trigger-paths.mermaid
  - Both rendered via Mermaid Chart MCP tool, vertical (mobile-friendly)

ADDED: Chronicler fix log (_tools/chronicler-fix-log.md)
  - Documents the flush_pipeline ordering fix for future reference

ADDED: Chronicler Quick Reference v1.1 to HA Suite NLM notebook
  - Source ID: 636b453c-34b2-4f15-9cf9-4fe993fc5353
  - Updated to include flush_pipeline as tool #10
  - Updated tool discovery note to reflect fix

ADDED: Wishlist items formalized
  - W-049: Caliper subdirectory recursion (MEDIUM priority)
  - W-050: NLM-to-Repo ingestion tool (MEDIUM priority)

ASSESSED: JSON Engineering Brief from NLMINTA S017
  - Items A-G reviewed against current pipeline maturity
  - Conclusion: No immediate AWSNBLM engineering work needed
  - JSON capabilities documented for when NLMINTA Phase 3 validates schemas

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - HA Suite NLM notebook now has 9 sources (added Chronicler reference)
  - _docs/diagrams/ directory established for visual documentation assets
  - extract.py repo sync still needed (live version diverged from repo copy)
