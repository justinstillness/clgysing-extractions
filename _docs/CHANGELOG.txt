CHANGELOG
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-09 | Session 020 | SeraphRecorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGED: extract.py upgraded from v5 to v6
  - Added failure resilience architecture
  - New failure taxonomy: NO_RESPONSE, EMPTY_ANSWER, PARTIAL, PARSE_ERROR,
    CORRELATION_FAILED
  - Ghost files written for every failed extraction (never silently drop)
  - Ghost files include: failure classification, preserved query text,
    raw response preview
  - _FAILED suffix added to ghost filenames
  - New _failed/ directory tree mirrors project routing structure
    (e.g., _failed/clgysing/PE/, _failed/clgysing/TS/)
  - Extraction summary now shows success/failure breakdown in console

ADDED: Ghost file routing
  - Failed extractions route to extracted/_failed/{project}/{pass}/
  - Structure mirrors successful extraction routing

ROOT CAUSE DOCUMENTED: NotebookLM rate limiting
  - Rapid-fire queries cause empty responses: {"prompts": []} (15 chars)
  - Some queries wait 25+ minutes before returning empty
  - Mitigation: space queries when batch testing

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Chronicler: _failed/ directories may appear in repo if push script
    is updated to include them
  - Infrastructure: v5 backup preserved as extract_v5_backup.py on EC2

DECISION: D-025 (extract.py v6 failure resilience architecture)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-08 | Session 019 | SeraphRecorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGED: extract.py upgraded from v4 to v5
  - Implemented SERAPH signal string parsing
  - 3-tier routing: Tagged→project folder, Unknown tag→_review, Untagged→_untagged
  - Signal format: [SERAPH: PROJECT=..., SP=..., PASS=..., NUM=...]
  - Auto-populates file headers with project, pass type, session metadata
  - Filename generation from signal string fields

ADDED: Socat artifact stripping (D-024)
  - Regex pass removes stray chunk headers from extracted content
  - Handles "< YYYY/MM/DD... length=..." lines injected by socat

VALIDATED: End-to-end tagged query routing to clgysing/phase2/VX/

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Chronicler: New directory structure (clgysing/phase2/{pass}/) created
    in GitHub repo for routed extractions

DECISION: D-024 (socat artifact stripping)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-07 | Session 018 | Chronicler, SeraphRecorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGED: Chronicler — bug fix for delete/move operations
  - httpx.delete does not accept JSON bodies
  - Fixed by switching to client.request("DELETE", ...) pattern
  - move_file and delete_file now functional

ADDED: Chronicler — flush_pipeline tool (10th tool)
  - On-demand extraction trigger callable from Claude
  - Runs extract.py and push-to-github.sh without SSH

ADDED: SeraphRecorder — daily-rotate.sh cron job
  - Runs at midnight UTC
  - Workflow: extract.py → push-to-github.sh → service restart (log rotation)
  - Fixed service name reference (notebooklm-mcp, not mcp-wrapper)

ADDED: Infrastructure — Port 2222 backup SSH
  - Later superseded by Tailscale/SSM preference

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Chronicler Quick Reference updated to v1.1 to include flush_pipeline

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-07 | Session 017 | Chronicler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: Chronicler deployed — new component in suite
  - GitHub repository interaction tool (read/write/move/delete)
  - Running on port 8002
  - Caddy routing: /repo/* → localhost:8002
  - Connector URL: https://mcp.justinstillness.com/repo/mcp
  - 9 initial tools: list_files, read_file, write_file, move_file,
    delete_file, create_directory, get_counter, increment_counter,
    server_status
  - Built via Claude Code on EC2

KNOWN ISSUE: Claude UI may not show Chronicler tools in auto-discovery
  - Tools ARE functional when called directly by name
  - Platform-level display issue, not a connectivity problem

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Caddy: New handle_path block added for /repo/* routing
  - Infrastructure: Port 8002 added to internal port map

DECISION: D-020 (Chronicler architecture and naming)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-06 | Session 016 | Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agent installed and registered
ADDED: Tailscale VPN installed on EC2 and local devices

CHANGED: Security hardening — SSH access restricted
  - Port 22 removed from EC2 Security Group
  - SSH now exclusively via Tailscale tunnel
  - Termius on iPhone updated with Tailscale IP

DECISION: D-023 (SSH restriction to Tailscale only)

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - All SSH-dependent operations (token refresh, maintenance) now
    require Tailscale connection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-06 | Sessions 013-014 | SeraphRecorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: SeraphRecorder pipeline deployed — new component in suite
  - Component 1: socat traffic capture (transparent proxy)
    * Listens on port 8000, forwards to Majeston on port 8100
    * Logs all traffic to /home/ubuntu/mcp-logs/traffic/
  - Component 2: extract.py parser
    * Parses JSONL logs, extracts notebook_query results
    * Generates clean text files with metadata headers
  - Component 3: push-to-github.sh
    * Syncs extracted files to clgysing-extractions repo
    * Uses dedicated GitHub PAT

CHANGED: Majeston port remapped
  - Majeston moved from port 8000 to port 8100 (internal only)
  - Socat wrapper occupies port 8000 (Caddy still routes to 8000)
  - Transparent to external connections — no Caddy changes needed

ADDED: Infrastructure — mcp-logger/ directory structure on EC2
  - /home/ubuntu/mcp-logger/ — scripts (extract.py, push-to-github.sh)
  - /home/ubuntu/mcp-logs/traffic/ — raw socat logs
  - /home/ubuntu/mcp-logs/raw/ — JSONL correlation output
  - /home/ubuntu/mcp-logs/extracted/ — text extraction output

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Majeston: Now runs on port 8100 behind socat wrapper
  - Chronicler: GitHub repo (clgysing-extractions) is the delivery target

DECISIONS: D-013 through D-017 (pipeline architecture)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-06 | Session 012 | SeraphRecorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: SeraphRecorder designed
  - Architecture: 4-component pipeline (capture, extract, push, cleanup)
  - Two data streams: Stream 1 (JSONL archive), Stream 2 (text extractions)
  - Named after Urantia "Recorders" (seraphic archivists)

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Design only — deployment in Sessions 013-014

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-05 | Sessions 010-011 | Caliper, Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: Caliper deployed — new component in suite
  - Document analysis MCP (GitHub file inventory)
  - Running on port 8001
  - FastMCP 2.14.5, uv runtime
  - GitHub PAT authentication (.env file)
  - 2 tools: analyze_github_folder, server_status
  - Caddy routing: /tools/* → localhost:8001
  - Connector URL: https://mcp.justinstillness.com/tools/mcp

CHANGED: Caddy routing — handle_path fix
  - Switched from handle to handle_path for /tools/* block
  - handle_path strips prefix before forwarding (required for Caliper)
  - Critical fix: without this, Caliper received /tools/mcp instead of /mcp

ADDED: Naming convention established (D-012)
  - Urantia beings → information/intelligence tools
  - Craft terminology → measurement/production tools
  - "MCP Workshop Suite" as umbrella name (now superseded by HA Suite)

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - Caddy: Now routes three paths (/, /tools/*, /repo/*)
  - FastMCP: description= parameter removed for v2.14.5 compatibility

DECISION: D-012 (Caliper architecture and naming convention)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-05 | Session 009 | Majeston
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGED: Majeston (jacob-bd) updated to v0.2.15

ADDED: Google Drive validated as bidirectional file bridge
  - Upload via Drive → ingest via Majeston source_add
  - Enables file transfer without SSH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-03 | Session 006 | Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDED: Mac maintenance scripts deployed
  - refresh-tokens.sh (push Majeston auth tokens to EC2)
  - health-check.sh (system diagnostic)

CHANGED: Mac DNS configured to Cloudflare/Google
  - Resolved health check failures caused by stale DNS cache

REMOVED: Docker fully uninstalled (D-009)
  - Recovered ~2.9GB disk + ~88MB RAM
  - Nothing in suite uses Docker

ADDED: Rate limiting via iptables (D-011)
  - 30 new connections per 60 seconds per IP on port 443
  - Persisted in /etc/iptables/rules.v4

ADDED: System updates applied (48 packages) (D-010)

DECISIONS: D-009 (Docker removal), D-010 (updates), D-011 (rate limiting)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-03 | Session 005 | Majeston, Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGED: Majeston migrated from Docker to native install
  - Installed via uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli
  - Configured as systemd service (notebooklm-mcp)
  - Port 8000, auto-start on boot, auto-restart on crash

CHANGED: Caddy migrated from Docker to native install
  - Simplified stack, recovered Docker memory overhead

REMOVED: Python bridge and roomi-fields container
  - Replaced by direct jacob-bd installation

CROSS-COMPONENT NOTES:
  - All components now run natively (no Docker anywhere)

DECISIONS: D-003 (direct install), D-007 (Caddy native), D-008 (Docker stop)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-02 | Sessions 001-002 | Infrastructure, Majeston

  - GoDaddy A record: mcp.justinstillness.com
  - Caddy reverse proxy with auto-TLS (Let's Encrypt)
  - Security Group: ports 22, 80, 443

ADDED: First NotebookLM access achieved
  - Initially via roomi-fields Docker container + custom Python bridge
  - Proved concept: Claude can query NotebookLM remotely

KNOWN ISSUE: roomi-fields incompatible with Claude Custom Connectors
  - REST API only; Claude requires MCP Streamable HTTP
  - Resolved in Session 005 by migrating to jacob-bd
