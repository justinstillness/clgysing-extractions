================================================================================

Based on the most recent sessions (specifically Session 016 and Session 017), here is the summary of accomplishments and the current state of your infrastructure.\
\
### **Recent Accomplishments (Sessions 016 & 017)**\
\
The primary focus of recent sessions has been hardening the infrastructure, establishing formal protocols, and closing the \"visibility loop\" so Claude can interact with the data it produces.\
\
**1. Deployment of \"Chronicler\" (Layer 4 Capability)**\
In Session 017, you successfully built and deployed **Chronicler**, a new MCP tool that gives Claude direct read/write access to your GitHub repository [1].\
*   **Purpose:** Before Chronicler, the pipeline could push data to GitHub, but Claude was \"blind\" to it. Chronicler allows Claude to list, read, move, and organize files within the `clgysing-extractions` repo [1].\
*   **Status:** Deployed on port 8002, routed via Caddy at `/repo/*`, and verified as fully operational [2, 3].\
\
**2. Pipeline Hardening & Security (Session 016)**\
You transitioned the system from a development setup to a production-hardened environment:\
*   **AWS Session Manager (SSM):** Replaced standard SSH (Port 22) with AWS Systems Manager. This allows you to manage the EC2 instance securely from any device (including mobile) without managing IP allowlists [4, 5].\
*   **Security Group Lockdown:** Ports 22 (SSH) and 3000 (old HTTP) were closed. Only Port 443 (HTTPS) remains open to the world for the MCP connection [6].\
*   **Naming Convention:** You formally adopted the name **SeraphRecorder** for the traffic-capture pipeline [7].\
\
**3. Standardization & \"LibForge\" Naming**\
You established the **LibForge** framework naming convention to keep tools organized [8]:\
*   **Majeston:** The NotebookLM MCP (Information/Reflectivity).\
*   **Caliper:** The Document Analysis MCP (Measurement/Inventory).\
*   **Chronicler:** The GitHub Repo MCP (Records/Archives).\
*   *Convention:* Information tools are named after Urantia beings; measurement/crafting tools are named after forge terms [8].\
\
**4. Design of Signal Strings**\
You designed a metadata protocol called **Signal Strings** (e.g., `[SERAPH: PROJECT=clgysing, PASS=VX...]`) [9]. These will be appended to queries to allow the extraction script to automatically tag and route files in the future, solving the issue of untagged outputs piling up [10].\
\

\
### **Current System State**\
\
#### **1. The MCP Workshop Suite (Infrastructure)**\
Your AWS EC2 instance is now running three distinct MCP services behind a Caddy reverse proxy.\
*   **Host:** `t3.micro` EC2 instance (Ubuntu), accessed via SSM [11].\
*   **Services:**\
    *   **Majeston (Port 8000):** Connects to NotebookLM (87+ notebooks).\
    *   **Caliper (Port 8001):** Analyzes document metrics (word counts, segmentation).\
    *   **Chronicler (Port 8002):** Manages the GitHub repository files.\
*   **Status:** All services are configured to auto-recover on reboot via systemd [12].\
\
#### **2. The SeraphRecorder Pipeline (Data Flow)**\
The pipeline is fully operational and automated on the capture side.\
1.  **Capture:** You query Majeston. A wrapper (`socat`) intercepts the traffic transparently [13].\
2.  **Log:** Raw traffic is saved to `~/.mcp-logs/raw/` on the server [14].\
3.  **Extract:** A script (`extract.py`) parses the logs, isolates the query answers, and saves them as text files in `_untagged/`.\
4.  **Push:** A script (`push-to-github.sh`) syncs these files to your private GitHub repo: `justinstillness/clgysing-extractions` [15].\
\
#### **3. Immediate Next Steps (From Session 017 Closeout)**\
*   **Token Rotation:** You need to rotate your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) because it was visible in logs, though this was deferred to avoid disrupting the build [16].\
*   **Protocol Implemen< 2026/02/08 00:23:22.000892788  length=245 from=10108 to=10352
tation:** You need to begin using the Signal Strings in your actual research sessions so the pipeline can start producing tagged data [17].
