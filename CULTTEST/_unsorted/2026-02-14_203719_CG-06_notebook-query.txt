Based on the `Thesis Methods.txt` and `v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map` sources, here are the specific query templates, prompt patterns, and structural details for TD-1 (Thesis Genesis) and TD-2 (Epistemic Regress).\
\
### **TD-1: Thesis Genesis Templates & Patterns**\
\
The best results for generating master theses from the corpus came from a **Structured Thesis Genesis Prompt**. The key to success was explicitly forcing the AI to produce *declarative claims* rather than topic lists.\
\
*   **Core Prompt Pattern:** Request four specific output components for each candidate:\
    1.  **Thesis Statement:** Must be a declarative argument (e.g., \"X causes Y because Z\"), not a description.\
    2.  **Typing:** Classify the thesis (e.g., Mechanistic, Prescriptive, Diagnostic, Comparative).\
    3.  **Evidence Base:** Cite specific corpus content supporting the claim.\
    4.  **Self-Assessment:** Rate as \"Thesis-Worthy\" (novel, bridges domains) or \"Observational\" (summary of text).\
\
*   **Effective Language:**\
    *   **\"Declarative claims, not topic lists\"** [1].\
    *   **\"Identify unexplored intersections and thematic gaps\"** [2].\
    *   **\"Distinguish between thesis-worthy and trivial observations\"** [3].\
\
*   **Best Structural Results:**\
    *   **Mechanistic Theses:** Focused on causal chains (e.g., \"Intellectual intimacy acts as an epistemic immune system\").\
    *   **Prescriptive Theses:** Focused on design requirements (e.g., \"Triadic Oversight requires topological alignment\").\
    *   **Gap Flags:** Explicitly identifying *why* a thesis cannot be fully argued yet (e.g., \"We know how the machine breaks, but not the engineering of how the fixed machine runs\") [4].\
\
### **TD-2: Epistemic Regress Templates & Interview Structure**\
\
The epistemic regress process uses a recursive questioning logic: **\"For this thesis to hold, what must be true?\"** The AI functions as an \"automated interviewee\" answering from the corpus.\
\
#### **Prompt Patterns by Degree**\
*   **Degree 0 $\\\ightarrow$ 1 (Master to Core Components):**\
    *   **Prompt:** \"For the master thesis '[Thesis Statement]' to hold, what supporting claims must be proven true? Identify critical path dependencies versus s< 2026/02/14 20:37:56.000904632  length=3332 from=8693 to=12024
upporting arguments.\"\
    *   **Result:** Produces ~7 thesis strings decomposed into \"Critical Path\" (essential) and \"Supporting\" (strengthening) [5], [6].\
\
*   **Degree 1 $\\\ightarrow$ 2 (Core to Detailed Unpacking):**\
    *   **Prompt:** Select a specific critical-path sub-thesis and ask: \"For the sub-thesis '[String X]' to be valid, what underlying mechanisms or axioms must be true?\"\
    *   **Result:** Decomposition into causal mechanisms or design constraints. Honest evidence strength ratings (e.g., \"Moderate - link is implicit\") are crucial here [7].\
\
*   **Degree 2 $\\\ightarrow$ 3 (Detailed to Bedrock/Convergence):**\
    *   **Prompt Logic:** Use **Conversation Threading** (passing `conversation_id`). Ask the AI to build upon its prior regression.\
    *   **Result:** NLM identifies \"High Novelty\" insights (physics of truth) or flags \"Bedrock/Axioms\" (foundational assumptions that cannot be regressed further, like \"Fourth Density influence\") [8], [9].\
\
#### **Epistemic Regress Interview Structure**\
\
The process follows a **Hybrid Automation Model** where the AI handles early degrees and the human takes over when convergence sets in.\
\
| Degree | Driver | Primary Question / Driver | Outcome |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| **Deg 0** | Human/AI | **Genesis:** \"What is the core claim?\" | Master Thesis |\
| **Deg 1** | AI (Auto) | **Decomposition:** \"What assertions underpin this claim?\" | Critical Path Strings |\
| **Deg 2** | AI (Auto) | **Mechanics:** \"How does this specific assertion function?\" | Causal Chains / Constraints |\
| **Deg 3** | Hybrid | **Depth/Bedrock:** \"What metaphysical axioms are required?\" | Bedrock Detection / Convergence |\
| **Deg 4+** | Human | **Extension:** \"What lies beyond the corpus?\" | Philosophical Extension |\
\
*   **Handling Branching vs. Linear Regress:**\
    *   **Branching (Width):** The AI naturally handles branching at Degree 1 by generating multiple supporting strings (e.g., 7 distinct sub-theses) [5].\
    *   **Linear (Depth):** To achieve depth, the user (or \"Conductor\" script) must **select a single critical path node** from Degree 1 and target the Degree 2 query specifically at that node. Trying to regress *all* nodes simultaneously degrades quality/depth due to output limits.\
    *   **Thesis Types:**\
        *   **Mechanistic** theses produce deep, narrow causal chains (Definition $\\\ightarrow$ Cause $\\\ightarrow$ Mechanism).\
        *   **Prescriptive** theses produce wide, structural networks (Goal $\\\ightarrow$ Constraint $\\\ightarrow$ Requirement) [10], [11].\
\
### **Critical Findings for Implementation**\
*   **Bedrock Detection:** The AI is capable of identifying \"Axiomatic Foundations\" where the regress stops because the corpus treats a concept as a given (e.g., \"Entrainment mechanism of truth\") [9].\
*   **Convergence Signal:** At Degree 3, the AI typically begins to \"converge\" (restating Degree 1 concepts with slightly more detail). This is the signal for the human editor to intervene [12].\
*   **Threading is Essential:** Degree 2 $\\\ightarrow$ 3 requires conversation threading to maintain context; without it, the AI loses the logical chain [13].
