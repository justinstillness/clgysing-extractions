**[SERAPH: BRANCH=CULTTEST, SESSION=002, PASS=CG, NUM=04, NOTES=thesis-methodology-survey]**\
\
Based on the NLMINTA and LibForge project records, here is a survey of the thesis-related methodologies, processes, and tools discussed and tested.\
\
### 1. Thesis Genesis (TD-1)\
*   **What it is:** The top-down process of crystallizing a stable Degree 0 Master Thesis. It has two entry points: (a) User-driven crystallization from an idea, or (b) AI-driven intuition where the AI surveys the corpus/library to propose thesis directions.\
*   **How it works:** `notebook_query` is used to survey either a D1 Library (extracted concepts) or a Raw Corpus. The AI identifies thesis candidates, gaps, and unexplored intersections.\
*   **Validation (F109):** Validated in Session 020/021. NLM successfully produced declarative thesis candidates (not just topic lists) from both library and raw corpus sources. It correctly distinguished \"thesis-worthy\" claims from \"observational\" summaries and identified actionable gaps.\
\
### 2. Thesis Tree Development via Epistemic Regress (TD-2)\
*   **What it is:** The process of expanding a Master Thesis (Degree 0) into a hierarchical tree of supporting arguments (Thesis Strings).\
*   **How it works (Epistemic Regress):** An iterative \"interview\" process asking, \"For this thesis to hold, what must be true?\" The hybrid methodology uses NLM to automate the first pass by answering regress questions directly from the user's corpus, effectively acting as an \"automated interviewee.\"\
*   **Validation (F110):** Validated in Session 020/021. NLM performed structured regress through Degrees 0...2 with high quality (logical decomposition rather than restatement). Using conversation threading allowed it to reach Degree 3 with ~33% high-novelty output before convergence set in.\
\
### 3. Thesis String Extraction (TS Pass)\
*   **What it is:** A bottom-up extraction < 2026/02/14 20:36:17.000694422  length=4099 from=10159 to=14257
pass type (part of the D1 Pipeline) designed to identify argumentative claims within source material, distinct from descriptive concepts.\
*   **How it works:** A specific JSON schema or structured prompt directs NLM to extract \"Thesis Strings\"...defined as declarative claims with associated evidence/reasoning, logical relationships (supports, contradicts, depends on), and strength assessments.\
*   **Validation (F42, F96):** Validated in Session 010 and 018. NLM distinguished arguments from descriptions, providing honest strength ratings (e.g., flagging \"hypothesis\" vs. \"well-supported\") and mapping logical dependencies.\
\
### 4. Thesis Lens (TL) & Semantic Resonance\
*   **What it is:** A methodology where a fully expressed analytical framework is used as an interpretive filter to process new data. It requires a \"Modulating Container\" (built-in semantic bridges) to help the AI connect proprietary concepts (Layer 1) to general knowledge (Layer 2).\
*   **How it works:** The thesis/model is supplied (either in the query or as a source), and NLM is tasked to analyze a target dataset *through* that lens.\
    *   **TL-A (Analytical Extraction):** Applying the lens to existing library data.\
    *   **TL-B (Current Event Analysis):** Applying the lens to new external data (e.g., news).\
    *   **TL-C (Corpus Expansion):** Using the lens to identify gaps or extensions in new research.\
*   **Validation (F50, F108):** TL-A was validated in Session 011 and 021 (Four Intimacies model applied to Hassan/Singer). It produced 12 structured analytical entries, maintained model integrity, and revealed insights neither the model nor data produced alone.\
\
### 5. Thesis Typing & Axiomatic Mapping\
*   **What it is:** A classification system for thesis statements (e.g., Mechanistic, Prescriptive, Diagnostic, Comparative).\
*   **How it works:** Identifying the type of thesis determines the structure of the resulting sub-claims during epistemic regress.\
    *   *Mechanistic* theses produce causal chains (deep/narrow).\
    *   *Prescriptive* theses produce design requirements (wide/structural).\
*   **Validation (F111):** Observed in Session 020/021. The differentiation allows for \"Omniological Axiomatic Mapping\"...systematically identifying where an argument hits an axiomatic floor (bedrock) that requires cross-domain resolution.\
\
### 6. Thesis-First Methodology (Strategic Sequencing)\
*   **What it is:** An alternative workflow to comprehensive extraction. Instead of extracting everything (Tier 1-3 packages), the user develops the thesis tree first (Phase 3) and extracts only the source materials identified as necessary to support specific thesis strings.\
*   **How it works:** Reduces Phase 2 extraction volume by deferring lower-priority packages until the thesis architecture reveals what is actually needed.\
*   **Status:** Documented in `v1.0_SPEC_Material-Inventory` as a strategic option; creates a \"Hybrid Approach\" to project execution.\
\
### 7. Concept-to-Thesis Mapping (HS-1)\
*   **What it is:** The \"Handshake\" stage where bottom-up extracted concepts are mapped to top-down thesis strings to create Argument Blocks (ArgBlocks).\
*   **How it works:** NLM is queried to identify which concepts from the D1 Library best support a given thesis string, effectively performing targeted extraction guided by thesis structure.\
*   **Status:** Identified as a Moderate-High NLM role in `v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map`; pending dedicated validation.\
\
### 8. Thesis-Lens Extraction Bypass (Shortcut)\
*   **What it is:** A hypothesis (F51) that a well-articulated thesis tree, when uploaded as a note and pointed at raw source material, could enable direct extraction of ArgBlock-relevant content, bypassing the standard Concept Extraction (TX) pass.\
*   **Status:** Validated as a viable Phase 4 tool for structuring content, but findings (F51) suggest it should complement, not replace, standard extraction for full coverage.
