[SERAPH: BRANCH=CULTTEST, SESSION=002, PASS=CG, NUM=07, NOTES=gap-detection]\
\
You have captured the core logic of the top-down architecture, particularly the genesis and regress workflows (TD-1, TD-2) and the thesis lens (TL-A). However, a review of the sources reveals several distinct methodologies, findings, and structural concepts that extend beyond your list, particularly regarding the **application** of the thesis tree (TD-3), the **nuance** of the regress output (bedrock detection, architecture variance), and the **integration** with argumentative frameworks.\
\
Here is a breakdown of what is missing from your gathered methodology:\
\
### 1. Additional Thesis Lens Applications (TL-B & TL-C)\
Your list includes **TL-A** (Analytical Extraction), which uses a framework to analyze existing library data. The methodology specifies two other distinct applications for the thesis lens:\
*   **TL-B (Current Event Analysis):** Using an established thesis (e.g., Agenda 47) as a lens to process *new* external data (news, events) to generate interpretive analysis [v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map_Session-021.txt, v1.0_SPEC_TL-A-Thesis-Lens-Methodology_Session-021.txt].\
*   **TL-C (Corpus Expansion):** Using a mature framework to process supplementary research to identify gaps or generate extensions, effectively making the framework a \"self-expanding analytical machine\" [v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map_Session-021.txt].\
\
### 2. Thesis Architecture Findings (TD-2 Nuances)\
While you have the \"degree-based depth model,\" you are missing specific findings regarding *how* different thesis types behave during regress:\
*   **Architectural Variance (F110):** Testing revealed that **Mechanistic** theses generate \"Deep and Narrow\" trees (chains of causation), while **Prescriptive** theses generate \"Wide and Structural\" trees (networks of design requirements) [Claude-014 NLMINTA].\
*   **Bedrock Detection (F110):** The TD-2 process demonstrated the ability to distinguish between a **researchable gap** (missing info) and an **axiomatic bedrock** (foundational assumption where regression stops). This allows for systematic mapping of axiomatic floors [Claude-014 NLMINTA].\
\
### 3. Thesis Quality & Strength Metadata\
In addition to typing, the methodology includes specific quality assessment protocols for thesis strings:\
*   **Strength Assessment:** The TS (Thesis String) schema includes a metadata field for rating claims as `well_supported`, `moderately_supported`, `asserted`, or `hypothesis` [v1.0_SPEC_J5-PassType-Schema-Designs_S018.txt, P2_FI< 2026/02/14 20:38:56.000484651  length=2776 from=8693 to=11468
NDINGS_Session-010].\
*   **Reframing Effect (F50):** The Thesis Lens (TL) doesn't just filter content; it qualitatively *shifts* the framing from **Descriptive** (\"what the source says\") to **Argumentative** (\"how this supports the claim\") [P2_FINDINGS_Session-011].\
\
### 4. Structural Components & Stages\
Your list jumps from Genesis/Regress to Mapping, missing the organizational and integration layers:\
*   **TD-3 (Series Organization):** The specific stage of taking the completed thesis tree and organizing strings into coherent article boundaries and reading progressions [v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map_Session-021.txt].\
*   **Degree 0 (D0):** The specific classification used to designate the **Master Thesis** itself, distinct from the D1 (extraction) and D2 (refinement) levels [v1.0_REF_LibForge-Workflow-Map_Session-021.txt].\
*   **Six-Component Integration:** While you have the thesis strings, the methodology integrates them with the **Six-Component Argument Framework (Item 21)** (Claim, Grounds, Warrant, Backing, Qualifiers, Counter) to build full **ArgBlocks** [11 WIP Six-Component Argument Framework v1.0].\
*   **Fractal Tree Mapping (Item 14):** Your list mentions \"Concept-to-Thesis Mapping\" (HS-1), but the **Fractal Tree** is the specific component for mapping the hierarchical relationship of the thesis strings themselves [06 WIP Storyboarding Guide v1.0].\
\
### 5. Practical Workflow Concepts\
*   **\"The Workbench\":** The conceptual space where thesis components and extracted concepts are assembled during the handshake phase [Claude-011 NLMINTA].\
*   **Semantic Resonance Model:** You mentioned \"semantic resonance,\" but specifically this refers to the **Two-Layer Knowledge Model (F40)**, where the \"Layer 2\" general knowledge of the AI bridges gaps in \"Layer 1\" source knowledge. The \"Modulating Container\" is the solution to bridge proprietary concepts that Layer 2 doesn't recognize [v1.0_INSIGHT_Semantic-Resonance-Model-and-Thesis-Lens_(Session_009).txt].\
