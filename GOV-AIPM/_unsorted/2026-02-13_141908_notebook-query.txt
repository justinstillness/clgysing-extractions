Here is the updated full text of **Appendix G: Artifact Taxonomy Reference** for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT. This version incorporates the new artifact classes (Phase Protocol, Findings Report, Branch Startup File, Cross-Branch Awareness Document) established in the v1.0.8 revision.\

\
**APPENDIX G: ARTIFACT TAXONOMY REFERENCE**\
\
**G.1 INTRODUCTION**\
\
This appendix provides a systematic classification framework for project artifacts, explaining why each artifact exists and how they relate to universal project functions. Users seeking practical guidance should reference Section 5 (Canonical Project Artifacts); this appendix provides deeper theoretical grounding for those who want to understand the system's design rationale.\
\
The framework presented here analyzes universal project functions that any structured work requires. Understanding these functions illuminates why certain artifacts exist and prevents the creation of redundant documentation.\
\
**G.2 THE TWELVE UNIVERSAL PROJECT FUNCTIONS**\
\
Every project, regardless of domain, must address twelve core functions. These functions exist whether explicitly managed or handled ad hoc. The GOV-AIPM system addresses each through specific artifacts and workflows.\
\
**FUNCTION 1: PROJECT DEFINITION**\
*   **What:** Establishing boundaries, objectives, and identity\
*   **Why:** Without clear definition, work lacks direction and scope creep is inevitable\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Guide, TPL-001 (Project Initiation Form), Phase Protocol (Phase-level definition), Branch Startup File (Branch definition)\
\
**FUNCTION 2: CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**\
*   **What:** Maintaining and transferring project knowledge across sessions\
*   **Why:** AI context windows are finite; external memory enables continuity\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap files, Project Guide, Session Logs, Phase Protocol, Notebook Connectivity, Cross-Branch Awareness Document\
\
**FUNCTION 3: SCOPE MONITORING**\
*   **What:** Tracking what's in-scope, out-of-scope, and deferred\
*   **Why:** Prevents scope creep; ensures intentional decisions about exclusions\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Guide, Backlog Register, Phase Protocol (Scope section)\
\
**FUNCTION 4: DECISION CAPTURE**\
*   **What:** Recording decisions with rationale and alternatives considered\
*   **Why:** Enables learning, prevents revisitation, supports auditability\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Decision Log, Findings Report (Evidentiary support)\
\
**FUNCTION 5: PROGRESS TRACKING**\
*   **What:** Monitoring work completion against plan\
*   **Why:** Provides visibility; enables adjustment; demonstrates advancement\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Roadmap, Session Logs, Cross-Branch Awareness Document\
\
**FUNCTION 6: SESSION ORCHESTRATION**\
*   **What:** Managing individual work sessions...initiation, execution, closeout\
*   **Why:** Each session must accomplish meaningful work within constraints\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap, Session Closeout Checklist, Session Log, Phase Protocol (Behavioral governance)\
\
**FUNCTION 7: PHASE MANAGEMENT**\
*   **What:** Organizing work into coherent phases with transitions\
*   **Why:** Complex projects require structured progression; phases enable planning\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Roadmap, Phase Execution Briefs, Phase Protocol\
\
**FUNCTION 8: QUALITY ASSURANCE**\
*   **What:** Verifying work meets standards and requirements\
*   **Why:** Prevents error accumulation; maintains deliverable quality\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Cross-AI Validation Protocol, Session Fidelity Report (SFR), Phase Protocol (Standards layer)\
\
**FUNCTION 9: ACCUMULATION HANDLING**\
*   **What:** Managing deferred items, insights, and out-of-phase discoveries\
*   **Why:** Not everything fits the current phase; systematic handling prevents loss\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Backlog Register, Insight Capture Protocol, Findings Reports\
\
**FUNCTION 10: RECOVERY SUPPORT**\
*   **What:** Handling failures, errors, and unexpected situations\
*   **Why:** Problems occur; systematic recovery prevents cascading failures\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Failure Recovery Worksheet, Token Exhaustion Recovery Protocol\
\
**FUNCTION 11: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER**\
*   **What:** Moving information between contexts, sessions, and stakeholders\
*   **Why:** AI instances don't share memory; humans need structured briefings\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Bootstrap files, Branch Startup File, Closure Report Section 7, Re-Entry Checklist, Cross-Branch Awareness Document\
\
**FUNCTION 12: PROJECT CLOSURE**\
*   **What:** Validating completion, documenting outcomes, preparing successors\
*   **Why:** Projects must end cleanly; lessons must transfer forward\
*   **GOV-AIPM Artifacts:** Project Closure Report\
\
**G.3 ARTIFACT-TO-FUNCTION MAPPING**\
\
The following table shows which artifacts serve which functions. Note that most artifacts serve multiple functions...this is by design. The system avoids creating single-purpose artifacts where existing ones can serve multiple needs.\

**G.4 LIFECYCLE MAPPING**\
\
Different artifacts become relevant at different project phases. This mapping shows when each artifact is typically created, actively used, or primarily referenced.\

\
**G.5 ARTIFACT ECOSYSTEM PRINCIPLES**\
\
Several principles govern the artifact ecosystem:\
\
1.  **MINIMUM SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION:** Create only artifacts that serve identified functions. Resist the urge to document for documentation's sake.\
2.  **INFORMATION LIVES IN ONE PLACE:** Avoid duplicating information across artifacts. Cross-reference instead. Designate one artifact as authoritative for specific data (e.g., Project Guide for scope, Phase Protocol for behavior).\
3.  **ARTIFACTS CONNECT:** Artifacts reference each other. The Bootstrap points to the Phase Protocol; the Closure Report draws from the Backlog Register; Session Logs reference Decision Logs. These connections form a coherent system.\
4.  **ARTIFACTS EVOLVE:** Some artifacts (Project Guide, Backlog Register, Cross-Branch Awareness) are living documents updated throughout the project. Others (Decision Log entries, Session Logs) are append-only records.\
5.  **ARTIFACTS SERVE TRANSFER:** Every artifact should support handoff...to a new AI session, to a future human reader, or to a follow-on project. Write for someone who has no context beyond what the artifact provides.\
\
**G.6 WHEN TO CREATE NEW ARTIFACTS**\
\
Before creating a new artifact type not listed in this taxonomy, verify:\
\
1.  **FUNCTION GAP:** Does an unserved function exist? If all twelve functions are adequately addressed, new artifacts risk redundancy.\
2.  **EXISTING COVERAGE:** Can an existing artifact be extended? Often a new section or field addition is preferable to a new artifact.\
3.  **INTEGRATION PATH:** How will the new artifact connect to existing ones? Orphaned artifacts create maintenance burden.\
4.  **LIFECYCLE FIT:** When is this artifact created, updated, and referenced? If the lifecycle is unclear, the artifact may not be needed.\
5.  **TOKEN ECONOMICS:** What's the context cost? Heavy artifacts that must be loaded frequently may not justify their value.\
\
**G.7 SCOPE BOUNDARIES**\
\
This framework deliberately excludes certain domains:\
\
*   **Multi-Team Coordination:** RACI matrices and team protocols assume multiple humans. GOV-AIPM targets the single user working with AI assistance.\
*   **Formal Project Management:** Work breakdown structures and Gantt charts add overhead inappropriate for the target use case. The system handles decomposition implicitly through phases and sessions.\
*   **Pre-Project Exploration:** Client assessment and consultative discovery precede what GOV-AIPM manages.\
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Coordination between autonomous agents is out of scope; the framework assumes human-in-the-loop with one primary AI assistant.\
\
**G.8 GLOSSARY INTEGRATION**\
\
The following terms from this appendix appear in Section 17.2 (Glossary):\
*   **Artifact:** A project document with defined purpose and structure\
*   **Artifact Ecosystem:** The interconnected set of project artifacts\
*   **Function (Project):** A universal capability that projects require\
*   **Reporting Triad:** The integrated Backlog/Roadmap/Closure system\
*   **Lifecycle Mapping:** Assignment of artifacts to project phases\
\
**G.9 FURTHER DEVELOPMENT**\
\
This appendix represents v1.0.8 of the taxonomy reference. Future versions may include visual artifact relationship diagrams and extended lifecycle guidance for complex projects. [1-25]
