Here is the updated full text for **Appendix H: Quick Start Guide**, revised for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT to formalize the Rooting (Phase 0) process and Phase Protocol integration.\

\
# APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE\
\
**Version:** 1.1 (GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT)\
**Date:** February 2026\
\
This appendix contains the complete Quick Start Guide. New users should begin here before engaging the full manual.\
\

\
## GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
### WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
### BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an Exploration Session (see below).\
\
#### READINESS CHECK\
\
Before initiating a formal project, you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   **If these answers are clear** ... Proceed to \"Starting Your First Project (Rooting)\"\
*   **If these answers are unclear** ... Start with an Exploration Session\
\
#### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
1.  Open a new AI chat.\
2.  Upload the AI Operations Manual.\
3.  Say: *\"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"*\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   \"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"\
*   \"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"\
*   \"What would success look like?\"\
*   \"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check when you're ready.\
\

\
### STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (ROOTING / PHASE 0)\
\
Every project begins with **Rooting** (Phase 0). This is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation...the Project Guide and Phase Protocol...before execution begins.\
\
**Do not rush this step.** If rooting takes a full session, that is a good investment.\
\
#### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
1.  **GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1.0.8.txt** (the framework)\
2.  **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form** (the intake template)\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You will develop it through dialog with the AI.\
\
#### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
#### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and TPL-001. Let's begin Phase 0 (Rooting). I expect you to probe my assumptions and help me structure this project before we finalize the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
#### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN\
\
**This is the critical step.**\
\
Rooting is not a passive transaction. It is a design session where the AI will:\
*   **Probe your objectives** (\"When you say 'improve', what specific outcome are you targeting?\")\
*   **Surface assumptions** (\"Are there stakeholders whose needs should shape this?\")\
*   **Structure the phases** (\"How does this work naturally divide? Should we separate research from drafting?\")\
*   **Determine AI behavior** (\"What role should I play? Do you need a critical validator or a creative drafter?\")\
\
**Your Job:**\
*   Answer thoughtfully.\
*   Push back if the AI misunderstands.\
*   Be honest about uncertainty (\"I don't know yet; let's leave that open\").\
\
This dialog produces the **Project Guide** (what we are building) and the **Base Phase Protocol** (how we will behave).\
\
#### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
\
After sufficient dialog, the AI will generate drafts of:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Defines scope, deliverables, constraints, and success criteria.\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Defines the AI's behavioral instructions for Phase 1 (e.g., formatting standards, methodology, tone).\
\
Review these carefully. The Phase Protocol is particularly important...it tells the AI how to act in every future session.\
\
#### STEP 6: CONFIRM AND FINALIZE\
\
When the documents are right, confirm:\
\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I am ready to close Rooting and begin Phase 1.\"\
\
The AI will then generate the **Bootstrap** for your first execution session.\
\
#### STEP 7: POST-ROOTING SETUP (USER ACTION)\
\
Before starting the next session, you must perform these setup actions:\
\
1.  **Download** the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\
2.  **Store** the Phase Protocol in your **Project Knowledge** (or equivalent persistent memory).\
3.  **Verify** the Bootstrap includes the mandatory instruction: *\"Review Phase Protocol from Project Knowledge.\"*\
\
You are now ready to execute.\
\
---\
\
### WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
\
After Rooting, you will use different workflows depending on where you are in the cycle:\
\
**CONTINUING A PROJECT (Session to Session):**\
*   Upload the **Bootstrap** from your prior session.\
*   The AI reads the **Phase Protocol** (from Project Knowledge) to restore behavior.\
*   The AI generates an **Alignment Checklist** to verify scope.\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.2.\
\
**RESUMING AFTER A BREAK (Days or Weeks Away):**\
*   Use the **Re-Entry Protocol** (TPL-007).\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.3.\
\
**TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES:**\
*   Use the **Phase Transition Protocol**.\
*   Evaluate the Phase Protocol (redraft if behaviors need to change).\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.4.\
\
---\
\
### KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**ROOTING (PHASE 0):** The mandatory setup phase. You cannot execute effectively until you have rooted the project.\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** The \"constitution\" for a phase. It tells the AI *how* to behave (formatting, tone, rules). It is stored in Project Knowledge and reviewed at every session start.\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A handoff document generated at the end of each session. It tells the AI *where* you left off (state, next actions).\
\
**DECISION LOG:** A record of choices made. Captures *why* a decision < 2026/02/13 15:23:57.000669263  length=1618 from=68221 to=69838
was made, preventing you from re-litigating it later.\
\
**CLOSEOUT:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly. The AI never auto-initiates closeout; you must trigger it (\"Close out\").\
\
---\
\
### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **SKIPPING ROOTING:** Rushing to \"real work\" without defining the Project Guide and Phase Protocol. This leads to drift and amnesia.\
2.  **IGNORING THE PHASE PROTOCOL:** Failing to store the protocol in Project Knowledge, causing the AI to revert to generic behaviors.\
3.  **NOT SAVING THE BOOTSTRAP:** Ending a session without generating the handoff file. You will lose context.\
4.  **SILENT SCOPE CREEP:** Allowing the project to expand without updating the Project Guide.\
5.  **TREATING AI AS ORACLE:** Accepting output without verification. You remain accountable for the result.\
\
---\
\
### GETTING HELP\
\
If you get stuck:\
*   Upload the manual and ask: *\"I'm having trouble with [X]. What does the framework say about this?\"*\
*   Check the **Troubleshooting Guide** (Appendix D).\
*   Review the **Failure Mode Catalog** (Appendix F).\
\
---\
\
