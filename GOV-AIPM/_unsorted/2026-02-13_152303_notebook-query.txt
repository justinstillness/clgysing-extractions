Based on the session logs and findings reports, here are the details regarding the J8 test and the CLGYSING notebook state:

### J8 Full-Scale D1 Library Test

*   **Target Selection:** The proposed target for the J8 test is **Source Package 12** ("Cultology Series ... Qs & Cs, CTGY Editor"), located within the *14 CLGYSING Source Pkgs* notebook [1]. This specific source was selected because it is a massive (~140,000 words) ChatGPT dialogue, making it a robust candidate for testing the pipeline's performance at scale [2], [3].
*   **Scope and Purpose:** J8 is designated as the "End of Phase 3" validation or capstone test [1], [4]. Its objective is to run **all extraction pass types** (TM, TX, VX, TS, RX, etc.) against a single source package to produce a complete, unified "D1 Library" (Degree 1 extraction product) [5], [1]. This differs from previous tests that focused on validating individual schemas or tools in isolation.
*   **Differentiation from SP03:**
    *   **Scale:** SP03 calibration testing used a small source package (~3,443 words) or existing extraction repositories to validate schemas and tools [6], [7]. J8 targets a raw source approximately 40x larger (140k words) to test production scalability [1], [3].
    *   **Goal:** SP03 focused on *calibration* (schema compliance, repeatability, exclusions) [8], [9]. J8 focuses on *production* (generating a comprehensive library file from raw "ore") [1].
    *   **Methodology:** J8 integrates the "reports-first" approach for broad capture to manage token economics on large files, reserving queries for surgical gap-filling, whereas SP03 testing relied heavily on query-based extraction [10], [11].

### Current State of CLGYSING Source Pkgs Notebook (cce3b796)

*   **Total Sources:** **16 sources** (15 content source packages + 1 Material Inventory specification document) [12], [13].
*   **Total Volume:** Approximately **362,000 words** [14], [15].
*   **Material Types:** The notebook contains a diverse range of materials including:
    *   **Published Articles:** e.g., Source 01 ("Wound, Then Rule") [14], [16].
    *   **Research Syntheses:** Compiled research documents [12].
    *   **Framework Deep-Dives:** e.g., Source 06 (Unified Model), Source 10 (Purpose of Life), Source 14 (Consciousness Models) [17], [18].
    *   **Dialogues:** Extensive ChatGPT and Claude dialogue exports (e.g., Source 12) [12], [15].
    *   **Operational Specs:** Source 16 is the "Material Inventory" document uploaded to act as metadata-as-source [19], [12].
