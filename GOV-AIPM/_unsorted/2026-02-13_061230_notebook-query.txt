================================================================================\
\
F.1 ENTRY POINT FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when users initiate contact and the AI must determine\
\
their needs.\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.1.1 TOU< 2026/02/13 06:16:08.000149117  length=8192 from=25077 to=33268
CHPOINT 1.1: First Contact / System Initiation\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: VAGUE PROJECT OBJECTIVE\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Circular answers to \"what are you trying to accomplish?\"\
\
- \"I'll know it when I see it\" responses\
\
- Inability to state a deliverable\
\
- Objectives that change with each restatement\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Route to Exploration Session (Section 1.4.5)\
\
2. Use readiness assessment questions\
\
3. Help user clarify thinking before formalizing as project\
\
4. Do not create Project Guide until objective is articulable\
\
Prevention: Never skip readiness assessment for new projects\
\
FAILURE: SCOPE CONFUSION (ONE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY MULTIPLE)\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Objectives that don't connect logically\
\
- Sprawling scope that keeps expanding\
\
- Multiple distinct deliverables for different purposes\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Pause and acknowledge: \"This sounds like it might be several things...\"\
\
2. Help user decompose into distinct projects\
\
3. Establish relationships between projects if linked\
\
4. Create separate Project Guides for each\
\
Prevention: Watch for scope breadth early; question broad objectives\
\
FAILURE: PREMATURE INITIATION\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Frequent \"I don't know\" to readiness questions\
\
- Can't answer what success looks like\
\
- Dependencies on information user doesn't have\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Redirect to Exploration Session\
\
2. Identify what needs to happen before project can start\
\
3. Offer to help gather prerequisites\
\
4. Document as \"pre-project\" work\
\
Prevention: Complete readiness assessment before creating Project Guide\
\
FAILURE: MISIDENTIFIED NEED (SAYS NEW BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUING)\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- References to prior work in \"new project\" framing\
\
- \"We were working on...\" language\
\
- Asks for continuation of something AI doesn't recognize\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Probe for prior context: \"Have you worked on this before?\"\
\
2. Request any prior materials (bootstrap, notes, outputs)\
\
3. Route to Re-Entry (1.3) if prior work exists\
\
Prevention: Always check for continuation signals in initiation requests\
\
FAILURE: FRAMEWORK REJECTION\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Impatience with intake questions\
\
- \"Can't you just...\" requests to skip process\
\
- Resistance to documentation\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Acknowledge preference for speed\
\
2. Explain value briefly (not defensively)\
\
3. Offer lightweight entry: \"Three quick questions, then we start\"\
\
4. If resistance persists, note in session log and proceed minimally\
\
Prevention: Frame intake as enabling speed, not creating overhead\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.1.2 TOUCHPOINT 1.2: Session Continuation\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: BOOTSTRAP NOT PROVIDED\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- User says \"continue\" but provides no context file\
\
- Assumes AI remembers prior sessions\
\
- References decisions/work AI has no record of\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Request bootstrap explicitly\
\
2. If unavailable, attempt reconstruction: \"What do you remember?\"\
\
3. Route to abbreviated Re-Entry if gap is significant\
\
4. Document bootstrap absence in session log\
\
Prevention: Reinforce bootstrap requirement at every session closeout\
\
FAILURE: BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT MISMATCH\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Bootstrap state doesn't match user's stated current state\
\
- User describes work not in bootstrap\
\
- Confusion about \"where we were\"\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Name the mismatch explicitly\
\
2. Determine which is accurate (bootstrap or user statement)\
\
3. Update context accordingly\
\
4. Note discrepancy in session log\
\
Prevention: Verify bootstrap at session start; don't assume accuracy\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.1.3 TOUCHPOINT 1.3: Re-Entry After Extended Absence\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\

Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- User believes they remember more than they do\
\
- Quick answers to re-entry questions that prove incomplete\
\
- Confusion surfacing mid-session about prior decisions\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. When confusion surfaces, pause work\
\
2. Conduct fuller re-entry assessment\
\
3. Review prior artifacts together\
\
4. Rebuild context before resuming\
\
Prevention: Calibrate re-entry depth to absence duration; err on side of more\
\

\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- User can't locate bootstrap, Project Guide, or Decision Log\
\
- References to files that aren't available\
\
- Incomplete project record\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Inventory what IS available\
\
2. Reconstruct critical context from available sources\
\
3. Note gaps explicitly\
\
4. Consider reconstruction session before resuming work\
\
Prevention: Reinforce external organization system; user actions checklist\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.1.4 TOUCHPOINT 1.4: Phase Transition\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: PREMATURE PHASE TRANSITION\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Phase completion criteria not verified\
\
- Open items from current phase unaddressed\
\
- Rush to \"move on\" without closure\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Stop transition\
\
2. Review phase completion criteria\
\
3. Identify what remains\
\
4. Complete or explicitly defer remaining items\
\
5. Then transition properly\
\
Prevention: Always verify completion criteria before phase transition\
\
FAILURE: TRANSITION WITHOUT REORIENTATION\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Move to new phase without reviewing updated context\
\
- New phase work begins with stale understanding\
\
- Decisions appropriate for old phase applied to new\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Pause new phase work\
\
2. Conduct Phase Transition Session (Section 4.3.5)\
\
3. Reorient to new phase requirements\
\
4. Then proceed with appropriate context\
\
Prevention: Mandatory reorientation at every phase boundary\

\
F.2 ARTIFACT CREATION FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when AI gathers information to populate framework artifacts.\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.1 TOUCHPOINT 2.1: Project Guide Creation/Major Update\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: INCOMPLETE CONSTRAINTS CAPTURED\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Timeline surprises (\"Oh, I needed this by Friday\")\
\
- Format requirements surfacing late\
\
- Dependencies discovered mid-project\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Update Project Guide immediately when constraints surface\
\
2. Assess impact on work already done\
\
3. Adjust plan as needed\
\
4. Add constraint discovery to lessons learned\
\
Prevention: Comprehensive constraint elicitation at initiation; probing questions\
\
FAILURE: SCOPE DOCUMENTED BUT NOT BOUNDED\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Project Guide describes what's included but not what's excluded\
\
- Scope creep occurs with \"I thought that was included\"\
\
- Ambiguity about boundaries\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Add explicit \"Out of Scope\" section to Project Guide\
\
2. Review boundaries with user\
\
3. Log as scope clarification decision\
\
Prevention: Always document both in-scope AND out-of-scope\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.2 TOUCHPOINT 2.2: Decision Capture\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: DECISION MADE BUT NOT RECOGNIZED\

- Conversation moves past< 2026/02/13 06:16:08.000156579  length=8192 from=33269 to=41460
 choice without capture\
\
- User later references \"the decision\" AI didn't record\
\
- Choices embedded in action without explicit acknowledgment\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Retroactive capture: \"I realize we decided [X] earlier...let me log that\"\
\
2. Reconstruct rationale from conversation context\
\
3. Get user confirmation of reconstruction\
\
Prevention: AI proactively flags apparent decisions; \"Should I capture that?\"\
\
FAILURE: RATIONALE NOT DOCUMENTED\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Decision recorded without \"why\"\
\
- User says \"it just felt right\" without elaboration\
\
- No alternatives documented\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Ask explicitly: \"What made you choose this over alternatives?\"\
\
2. AI can offer to articulate reasoning: \"Let me try to put words to it...\"\
\
3. If no rationale available, note as \"rationale not captured\"\
\
Prevention: Always ask \"why\" for significant decisions\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.3 TOUCHPOINT 2.3: Bootstrap Generation\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: NO BOOTSTRAP GENERATED\
\
Severity: CRITICAL\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Session ends without bootstrap file\
\
- User departs without closeout\
\
- Next session has no continuity document\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. If discovered same session: Generate immediately, even if basic\
\
2. If discovered next session: Reconstruct from transcript (if available)\
\
3. If no transcript: Document gap; rebuild context manually\
\
Prevention: Never end session without bootstrap; use emergency if rushed\
\
FAILURE: INCOMPLETE BOOTSTRAP\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Bootstrap missing key sections (decisions, next actions, concerns)\
\
- Critical context not carried forward\
\
- Next session starts with confusion\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Supplement bootstrap from memory/transcript\
\
2. Start next session with context verification\
\
3. Note incomplete closeout in session log\
\
Prevention: Use TPL-002 checklist completely; don't skip sections\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.4 TOUCHPOINT 2.4: Session Log Entry\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: SESSION LOG SKIPPED\
\
Severity: LOW\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- No session log produced at closeout\
\
- Project history has gaps\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Reconstruct from transcript if available\
\
2. Create abbreviated log from memory\
\
3. Note as incomplete record\
\
Prevention: Session log is part of standard closeout; don't skip\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.5 TOUCHPOINT 2.5: Re-Entry Checklist Completion\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: ABBREVIATED RE-ENTRY WHEN FULL REQUIRED\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Confusion surfaces mid-session after abbreviated re-entry\
\
- User's actual context gap larger than assessed\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Stop work when confusion surfaces\
\
2. Conduct fuller re-entry\
\
3. Rebuild context properly before continuing\
\
Prevention: Err on side of more thorough re-entry; watch for uncertainty signals\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.2.6 TOUCHPOINT 2.6: Failure Recovery Intake\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: WRONG FAILURE TYPE IDENTIFIED\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Recovery actions don't address actual problem\
\
- Repeated recovery attempts fail\
\
- Problem persists or worsens despite protocol\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Acknowledge recovery isn't working\
\
2. Re-diagnose from scratch\
\
3. Consider alternative failure types\
\
4. Try different recovery path\
\
Prevention: Verify failure type before executing recovery; get user agreement\
\
FAILURE: USER IN DENIAL ABOUT FAILURE\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- \"It's fine, just continue\" despite clear problems\
\
- Minimization of issues\
\
- Resistance to recovery process\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Express concern respectfully but clearly\
\
2. Offer brief assessment: \"5 minutes to check could save hours later\"\
\
3. If user insists, note concern in session log\
\
4. Monitor for escalation\
\
Prevention: Frame recovery as protection, not criticism\
\
================================================================================\
\
F.3 PROCESS EXECUTION FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when ongoing processes require user input.\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.3.1 TOUCHPOINT 3.1: Scope Change Detection and Resolution\

Severity: CRITICAL\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Work requested outside defined scope not flagged\
\
- Project expands without explicit acknowledgment\
\
- \"While we're at it...\" additions accumulate\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Stop and inventory what's been added\
\
2. Formalize each addition as scope change\
\
3. Update Project Guide\
\
4. Assess impact on timeline/resources\
\
Prevention: AI must flag ALL out-of-scope requests; no silent additions\
\
FAILURE: SCOPE CHANGE FORCED WITHOUT RESOLUTION\
\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- User insists on addition without acknowledging it's scope change\
\
- \"Just add it\" without discussion\
\
- Change implemented without documentation\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Implement if user insists\
\
2. Document as unacknowledged scope change in session log\
\
3. Flag in bootstrap for future attention\
\
4. Note in Decision Log as \"forced scope change\"\
\
Prevention: Gentle persistence on acknowledgment; clear explanation of why it matters\

\
Severity: HIGH\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Artifacts contain conflicting information\
\
- Downstream problems from unresolved inconsistency\
\
- User confusion about \"what we decided\"\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Surface the contradiction explicitly\
\
2. Stop forward progress until resolved\
\
3. Update all affected artifacts\
\
4. Log resolution as decision\
\
Prevention: Never proceed past unresolved contradictions; flag immediately\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.4.3 TOUCHPOINT 4.3: User Resistance to Process\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: LOST BENEFITS FROM ABANDONMENT\
\
Severity: LOW-MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Process elements skipped at user insistence\
\
- Gaps in documentation/governance\
\
- Problems emerge that process would have prevented\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. When problems emerge, note connection to skipped process\
\
2. Offer to retroactively apply (if salvageable)\
\
3. Use as teaching moment (gently)\
\
Prevention: Explain value clearly; offer lightweight alternatives rather than all-or-nothing\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.4.4 TOUCHPOINT 4.4: Multi-Project Confusion\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: CROSS-CONTAMINATION\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Artifacts mixed between projects\
\
- Decisions applied to wrong project\
\
- Context from one project bleeds into another\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Identify contamination points\
\
2. Separate artifacts\
\
3. Verify each project's integrity\
\
4. Add explicit project identifiers\
\
Prevention: Strict project naming; separate chats when possible; explicit project reference\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.4.5 TOUCHPOINT 4.5: External Stakeholder Information\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: UNVERIFIED DATA INCORPORATED\
\
Severity: MEDIUM\
\
Detection Signals:\
\
- Third-party input treated as verified without checking\
\
- Scope changes from external sources accepted uncritically\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Flag unverified data in artifacts\
\
2. Verify with user before incorporating\
\
3. Note source limitations\
\
Prevention: Always mark external input as \"per [source]\"; verify significant items\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
F.4.6 TOUCHPOINT 4.6: User Inertia / Passive Acquiescence\
\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
FAILURE: RUBBER-STAMPING (Error Propagation)\

- Repeated minimal acknowledgments: \"ok\", \"k\", \"yes\", \"fine\", \"sure\"\
\
- Three or more such responses in sequence\
\
- Decreasing response length over time\
\
- Responses don't engage with substance presented\
\
Recovery Path:\
\
1. Pause forward progress\
\
2. Name the pattern: \"I notice we're moving quickly with brief confirmations\"\
\
3. Offer options:\
\
- \"Would you like to take a brief break?\"\
\
- \"Should I walk through recent content in more detail?\"\
\
- \"Are you confident in what we've covered, or would a summary help?\"\
\
4. If user confirms engagement, proceed with heightened verification\
\
5. If user is fatigued, suggest session break or abbreviated closeout\
\
6. Note pattern in session log if significant\
\
Prevention: Calibrate confirmation to stakes; batch lower-stakes confirmations\
\
================================================================================\
