Based on the GOV-AIPM project records, specifically the findings and drafting plans for v1.0.8, the answer involves a distinction between the **Quick Start Guide** and a broader **User Guide**.

**1. Was a standalone user guide created?**
**No, a comprehensive standalone User Guide was explicitly deferred.**
During Session 032, Decision **D-032-005** established that the "standalone User Guide" would be deferred as a separate deliverable for a future phase (likely Phase 7). The rationale was that the manual revision was the primary scope, and a full User Guide was substantial enough to warrant dedicated development [1, 2]. Instead, critical user behaviors were embedded directly into the manual as "USER ACTION" or "USER BEHAVIOR" callout boxes throughout relevant sections [3, 4].

**2. Is Appendix H the Quick Start Guide?**
**Yes, Appendix H is the Quick Start Guide.**
Appendix H was originally added in v1.0.7 and updated in v1.0.8. It is explicitly designed to serve as a "standalone onboarding guide for new users" that can be distributed separately from the full manual [5, 6]. Its purpose is to get a new user from "I just downloaded this" to "I'm working on my first project" in about 30 minutes [6].

**Summary of the Plan:**
*   **Appendix H (Quick Start Guide):** Created and included in the manual (Volume 6c). It provides immediate orientation and can be pulled out as a standalone document [7, 8].
*   **User Guide (Comprehensive):** Planned but deferred. This would cover the ~10% of system operations that are user-facing (as opposed to AI-facing) in greater depth than the Quick Start Guide [1, 9].
*   **User Behavior Callouts:** Implemented in v1.0.8 as an intermediate solution, embedding user instructions directly into the AI-facing manual sections (e.g., Sections 3, 4, 6, 10) [10, 11].
