Based on Section 2.5 of the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT** (Volume 1: Foundations), here is the complete description of the Three Cycles of AI-Assisted Work and the Parallel Support Track.\
\
These cycles are nested temporal structures that provide a mental map for navigating the system...helping users identify which tools apply when and how to maintain orientation across different scales of work [1].\
\
### 1. Project Lifecycle (Macro Cycle)\
**Scope:** The strategic level spanning the entire arc from conception to completion [2].\
**Temporal Scope:** Days to months.\
**Key Question:** \"Where is this project in its overall journey?\"\
\
**The Sine Wave Model:**\
The project rhythm alternates between **Peaks** (active phase work/execution) and **Zero-crossings** (transition work/planning) [3].\
\
**Phases:**\
*   **Phase 0 ... Rooting:** The deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation before execution begins [4]. It produces the **Project Guide** and **Base Phase Protocol**. Rooting is collaborative design work, not form completion [5], and includes establishing context, defining the destination, determining scope, structuring phases, and preparing for execution [5, 6].\
*   **Execution Phases (Phases 1 through N):** The bulk of project work. Each phase operates under its Phase Protocol and advances through defined milestones toward exit criteria [7].\
*   **Completion:** Final deliverables are produced, reviewed, and accepted. Artifacts are archived, and the **Project Closure Report** (TPL-022) formalizes the process [8].\
\
### 2. Session Lifecycle (Meso Cycle)\
**Scope:** The tactical level encompassing what happens each time you sit down to work...from preparation to closeout [9].\
**Temporal Scope:** Minutes to hours per session.\
**Key Question:** \"What do I need to do before, during, and after this session?\"\
\
**Phases:**\
*   **Preparation:** Gathering materials, reviewing prior state, and identifying objectives before opening the chat [10].\
*   **Initiation:** Establishing context at session start using the **Bootstrap** (TPL-002) and confirming alignment via the Phase Protocol [10].\
*   **Active Work:** The productive core (drafting, analysis, iteration). Token awareness and alignment maintenance are critical here [11].\
*   **Closeout:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly to enable resumption. Includes generating the next Bootstrap, updating the **Session Log** (TPL-005), and exporting the transcript [11].\
\
### 3. Interaction Cycle (Micro Cycle)\
**Scope:** The operational level of moment-to-moment dialogue between human and AI [12].\
**Temporal Scope:** Seconds to minutes per interaction.\
**Key Question:** \"How do I work effectively with AI moment to moment?\"\
\
**Phases:**\
*   **Prompt Formulation:** Crafting the input with clear requests, context, and constraints. Governed by the **Explicit Alignment Principle** [12].\
*   **AI Response:** The model generates output based on the prompt and accumulated context [13].\
*   **Verification:** Evaluating the response for accuracy, reasoning, and address of the request. Intensity scales with stakes [13].\
*   **Adjustment:** Accepting, refi< 2026/02/13 21:01:35.000288197  length=1582 from=8693 to=10274
ning, redirecting, or resetting based on verification. This feeds the next prompt formulation [13].\
\
### 4. The Parallel Support Track\
**Scope:** Activities outside the AI environment that enable success within it [14].\
**Key Question:** \"What do I need to do outside of AI chat to make this work?\"\
\
**Activities:**\
*   **File Management:** Organizing folders and maintaining naming conventions [14].\
*   **Cross-AI Validation:** Using secondary platforms for independent review [14].\
*   **Weekly Review:** Periodic assessment of status and system health (TPL-006) [15].\
*   **Tool Maintenance:** Keeping capture and export tools functional [15].\
*   **Context Preparation:** Assembling documents and questions before sessions [15].\
\
### How They Nest\
The cycles are nested containers, not just adjacent phases [16]:\
*   **Projects** contain **Sessions**.\
*   **Sessions** contain **Interactions**.\
\
**Navigation & Diagnosis:**\
Problems should be diagnosed by their cycle level [16]:\
*   **Interaction-level:** Bad output or misunderstanding ... Fix with prompt refinement and verification.\
*   **Session-level:** Lost context or decision drift ... Fix with better Bootstraps and closeout discipline.\
*   **Project-level:** Scope drift or unclear objectives ... Fix by revisiting the Project Guide and Phase definitions.\
\
Tool selection is also determined by cycle location (e.g., TPL-001 for Macro, TPL-002 for Meso, Prompt Library for Micro) [17].
