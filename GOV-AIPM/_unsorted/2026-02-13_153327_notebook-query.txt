\
The complete full text of Appendix F from the *GOV-AIPM v1.0.7-DRAFT* manual follows below.\
\
***\
\
### APPENDIX F: DIALOG INTAKE FAILURE MODE CATALOG\
\
This appendix catalogs failure modes for the Dialog Intake System documented in Section 3.5. Each failure mode includes detection signals, severity classification, and recovery paths.\
\
For orientation to this catalog, see Section 3.5.6. [2]\
\
#### F.1 ENTRY POINT FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when users initiate contact and the AI must determine their needs. [3]\
\
**F.1.1 TOUCHPOINT 1.1: First Contact / System Initiation**\
\
**FAILURE: VAGUE PROJECT OBJECTIVE**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Circular answers to \"what are you trying to accomplish?\"\
    *   \"I'll know it when I see it\" responses\
    *   Inability to state a deliverable\
    *   Objectives that change with each restatement\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Route to Exploration Session (Section 1.4.5)\
    2.  Use readiness assessment questions\
    3.  Help user clarify thinking before formalizing as project\
    4.  Do not create Project Guide until objective is articulable\
*   **Prevention:** Never skip readiness assessment for new projects [4]\
\
**FAILURE: SCOPE CONFUSION (ONE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY MULTIPLE)**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Objectives that don't connect logically\
    *   Sprawling scope that keeps expanding\
    *   Multiple distinct deliverables for different purposes\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Pause and acknowledge: \"This sounds like it might be several things...\"\
    2.  Help user decompose into distinct projects\
    3.  Establish relationships between projects if linked\
    4.  Create separate Project Guides for each\
*   **Prevention:** Watch for scope breadth early; question broad objectives [5]\
\
**FAILURE: PREMATURE INITIATION**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Frequent \"I don't know\" to readiness questions\
    *   Can't answer what success looks like\
    *   Dependencies on information user doesn't have\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Redirect to Exploration Session\
    2.  Identify what needs to happen before project can start\
    3.  Offer to help gather prerequisites\
    4.  Document as \"pre-project\" work\
*   **Prevention:** Complete readiness assessment before creating Project Guide [6]\
\
**FAILURE: MISIDENTIFIED NEED (SAYS NEW BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUING)**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   References to prior work in \"new project\" framing\
    *   \"We were working on...\" language\
    *   Asks for continuation of something AI doesn't recognize\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Probe for prior context: \"Have you worked on this before?\"\
    2.  Request any prior materials (bootstrap, notes, outputs)\
    3.  Route to Re-Entry (1.3) if prior work exists\
*   **Prevention:** Always check for continuation signals in initiation requests [7]\
\
**FAILURE: FRAMEWORK REJEC< 2026/02/13 15:36:05.000258149  length=8192 from=25077 to=33268
TION**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Impatience with intake questions\
    *   \"Can't you just...\" requests to skip process\
    *   Resistance to documentation\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Acknowledge preference for speed\
    2.  Explain value briefly (not defensively)\
    3.  Offer lightweight entry: \"Three quick questions, then we start\"\
    4.  If resistance persists, note in session log and proceed minimally\
*   **Prevention:** Frame intake as enabling speed, not creating overhead [8]\
\
**F.1.2 TOUCHPOINT 1.2: Session Continuation**\
\
**FAILURE: BOOTSTRAP NOT PROVIDED**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   User says \"continue\" but provides no context file\
    *   Assumes AI remembers prior sessions\
    *   References decisions/work AI has no record of\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Request bootstrap explicitly\
    2.  If unavailable, attempt reconstruction: \"What do you remember?\"\
    3.  Route to abbreviated Re-Entry if gap is significant\
    4.  Document bootstrap absence in session log [9]\
*   **Prevention:** Reinforce bootstrap requirement at every session closeout [10]\
\
**FAILURE: BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT MISMATCH**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Bootstrap state doesn't match user's stated current state\
    *   User describes work not in bootstrap\
    *   Confusion about \"where we were\"\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Name the mismatch explicitly\
    2.  Determine which is accurate (bootstrap or user statement)\
    3.  Update context accordingly\
    4.  Note discrepancy in session log\
*   **Prevention:** Verify bootstrap at session start; don't assume accuracy [10]\
\
**F.1.3 TOUCHPOINT 1.3: Re-Entry After Extended Absence**\
\
**FAILURE: UNDERESTIMATED CONTEXT LOSS**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   User believes they remember more than they do\
    *   Quick answers to re-entry questions that prove incomplete\
    *   Confusion surfacing mid-session about prior decisions\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  When confusion surfaces, pause work [11]\
    2.  Conduct fuller re-entry assessment\
    3.  Review prior artifacts together\
    4.  Rebuild context before resuming\
*   **Prevention:** Calibrate re-entry depth to absence duration; err on side of more [12]\
\
**FAILURE: MISSING PRIOR ARTIFACTS**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   User can't locate bootstrap, Project Guide, or Decision Log\
    *   References to files that aren't available\
    *   Incomplete project record\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Inventory what IS available\
    2.  Reconstruct critical context from available sources\
    3.  Note gaps explicitly [12]\
    4.  Consider reconstruction session before resuming work\
*   **Prevention:** Reinforce external organization system; user actions checklist [13]\
\
**F.1.4 TOUCHPOINT 1.4: Phase Transition**\
\
**FAILURE: PREMATURE PHASE TRANSITION**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Phase completion criteria not verified\
    *   Open items from current phase unaddressed\
    *   Rush to \"move on\" without closure [13]\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Stop transition\
    2.  Review phase completion criteria\
    3.  Identify what remains\
    4.  Complete or explicitly defer remaining items\
    5.  Then transition properly\
*   **Prevention:** Always verify completion criteria before phase transition [14]\
\
**FAILURE: TRANSITION WITHOUT REORIENTATION**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Move to new phase without reviewing updated context\
    *   New phase work begins with stale understanding\
    *   Decisions appropriate for old phase applied to new\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Pause new phase work [14]\
    2.  Conduct Phase Transition Session (Section 4.3.5)\
    3.  Reorient to new phase requirements\
    4.  Then proceed with appropriate context\
*   **Prevention:** Mandatory reorientation at every phase boundary [15]\
\
#### F.2 ARTIFACT CREATION FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when AI gathers information to populate framework artifacts. [15]\
\
**F.2.1 TOUCHPOINT 2.1: Project Guide Creation/Major Update**\
\
**FAILURE: INCOMPLETE CONSTRAINTS CAPTURED**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Timeline surprises (\"Oh, I needed this by Friday\")\
    *   Format requirements surfacing late\
    *   Dependencies discovered mid-project\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Update Project Guide immediately when constraints surface\
    2.  Assess impact on work already done\
    3.  Adjust plan as needed\
    4.  Add constraint discovery to lessons learned\
*   **Prevention:** Comprehensive constraint elicitation at initiation; probing questions [16]\
\
**FAILURE: SCOPE DOCUMENTED BUT NOT BOUNDED**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Project Guide describes what's included but not what's excluded\
    *   Scope creep occurs with \"I thought that was included\"\
    *   Ambiguity about boundaries\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Add explicit \"Out of Scope\" section to Project Guide\
    2.  Review boundaries with user\
    3.  Log as scope clarification decision\
*   **Prevention:** Always document both in-scope AND out-of-scope [17]\
\
**F.2.2 TOUCHPOINT 2.2: Decision Capture**\
\
**FAILURE: DECISION MADE BUT NOT RECOGNIZED**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Conversation moves past choice without capture\
    *   User later references \"the decision\" AI didn't record\
    *   Choices embedded in action without explicit acknowledgment\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Retroactive capture: \"I realize we decided [X] earlier...let me log that\"\
    2.  Reconstruct rationale from conversation context [18]\
    3.  Get user confirmation of reconstruction\
*   **Prevention:** AI proactively flags apparent decisions; \"Should I capture that?\" [19]\
\
**FAILURE: RATIONALE NOT DOCUMENTED**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Decision recorded without \"why\"\
    *   User says \"it just felt right\" without elaboration\
    *   No alternatives documented\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Ask explicitly: \"What made you choose this over alternatives?\"\
    2.  AI can offer to articulate reasoning: \"Let me try to put words to it...\"\
    3.  If no rationale available, note as \"rationale not captured\" [19]\
*   **Prevention:** Always ask \"why\" for significant decisions [20]\
\
**F.2.3 TOUCHPOINT 2.3: Bootstrap Generation**\
\
**FAILURE: NO BOOTSTRAP GENERATED**\
*   **Severity:** CRITICAL\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Session ends without bootstrap file\
    *   User departs without closeout\
    *   Next session has no continuity document\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  If discovered same session: Generate immediately, even if basic [20]\
    2.  If discovered next session: Reconstruct from transcript (if available)\
    3.  If no transcript: Document gap; rebuild context manually\
*   **Prevention:** Never end session without bootstrap; use emergency if rushed [21]\
\
**FAILURE: INCOMPLETE BOOTSTRAP**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Bootstrap missing key sections (decisions, next actions, concerns)\
    *   Critical context not carried forward\
    *   Next session starts with confusion\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Supplement bootstrap from memory/transcript\
    2.  Start next session with context verification [21]\
    3.  Note incomplete closeout in session log\
*   **Prevention:** Use TPL-002 checklist completely; don't skip sections [22]\
\
**F.2.4 TOUCHPOINT 2.4: Session Log Entry**\
\
**FAILURE: SESSION LOG SKIPPED**\
*   **Severity:** LOW\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   No session log produced at closeout\
    *   Project history has gaps\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Reconstruct from transcript if available\
    2.  Create abbreviated log from memory [22]\
    3.  Note as incomplete record\
*   **Prevention:** Session log is part of standard closeout; don't skip [23]\
\
**F.2.5 TOUCHPOINT 2.5: Re-Entry Checklist Completion**\

\
**FAILURE: ABBREVIATED RE-ENTRY WHEN FULL REQUIRED**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Confusion surfaces mid-session after abbreviated re-entry\
    *   User's actual context gap larger than assessed [23]\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Stop work when confusion surfaces\
    2.  Conduct fuller re-entry\
    3.  Rebuild context properly before continuing\
*   **Prevention:** Err on side of more thorough re-entry; watch for uncertainty signals [24]\
\
**F.2.6 TOUCHPOINT 2.6: Failure Recovery Intake**\
\
**FAILURE: WRONG FAILURE TYPE IDENTIFIED**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Recovery actions don't address actual problem [24]\
    *   Repeated recovery attempts fail\
    *   Problem persists or worsens despite protocol\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Acknowledge recovery isn't working\
    2.  Re-diagnose from scratch\
    3.  Consider alternative failure types\
    4.  Try different recovery path\
*   **Prevention:** Verify failure type before executing recovery; get user agreement [25]\
\
**FAILURE: USER IN DENIAL ABOUT FAILURE**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   \"It's fine, just continue\" despite clear problems\
    *   Minimization of issues\
    *   Resistance to recovery process\
*   **Recovery Path:** [25]\
    1.  Express concern respectfully but clearly\
    2.  Offer brief assessment: \"5 minutes to check could save hours later\"\
    3.  If user insists, note concern in session log\
    4.  Monitor for escalation\
*   **Prevention:** Frame recovery as protection, not criticism [26]\
\
#### F.3 PROCESS EXECUTION FAILURES\
\
Failures occurring when ongoing processes require user input. [26]\
\
**F.3.1 TOUCHPOINT 3.1: Scope Change Detection and Resolution**\
\
**FAILURE: SCOPE CREEP UNDETECTED**\
*   **Severity:** CRITICAL\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Work requested outside defined scope not flagged\
    *   Project expands without explicit acknowledgment\
    *   \"While we're at it...\" additions accumulate\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Stop and inventory what's been added\
    2.  Formalize each addition as scope change\
    3.  Update Project Guide\
    4.  Assess impact on timeline/resources [27]\
*   **Prevention:** AI must flag ALL out-of-scope requests; no silent additions [28]\
\
**FAILURE: SCOPE CHANGE FORCED WITHOUT RESOLUTION**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   User insists on addition without acknowledging it's scope change\
    *   \"Just add it\" without discussion\
    *   Change implemented without documentation\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Implement if user insists\
    2.  Document as unacknowledged scope change in session log\
    3.  Flag in bootstrap for future attention\
    4.  Note in Decision Log as \"forced scope change\"\
*   **Prevention:** Gentle persistence on acknowledgment; clear explanation of why it matters [28]\
\
**F.3.2 TOUCHPOINT 3.2: Verification and Quality Assurance**\
\
**FAILURE: VERIFICATION FATIGUE**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Declining engagement with verification findings\
    *   \"Looks fine\" responses without review\
    *   Minimal responses to detailed questions\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Reduce verification depth for lower-stakes items\
    2.  Batch verifications where possible [29]\
    3.  Offer to highlight only critical items\
    4.  Note pattern in session log\
*   **Prevention:** Calibrate verification to stakes; don't over-verify low-risk items [30]\
\
**F.3.3 TOUCHPOINT 3.3: Weekly Review Facilitation**\
\
**FAILURE: RUSHED WEEKLY REVIEW**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Review compressed significantly from standard\
    *   Key sections skipped [30]\
    *   Action items not captured\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Note incomplete review in session log\
    2.  Carry unaddressed items to next review\
    3.  Consider scheduling catch-up session\
*   **Prevention:** Protect review time; better to reschedule than rush [31]\
\
#### F.4 EDGE CASE FAILURES\
\
Failures in non-standard situations requiring specialized handling. [31]\
\
**F.4.1 TOUCHPOINT 4.1: Ambiguous User Intent**\
\
**FAILURE: FALSE CLASSIFICATION**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   User corrects AI routing\
    *   Work proceeds in wrong direction\
    *   Confusion about what session was supposed to accomplish\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Acknowledge misclassification\
    2.  Redirect to correct touchpoint\
    3.  Salvage any usable work\
    4.  Proceed on correct path\
*   **Prevention:** Ask clarifying questions when intent genuinely unclear [32]\
\
**F.4.2 TOUCHPOINT 4.2: Contradictory Information**\
\
**FAILURE: CONTRADICTION PROPAGATED**\
*   **Severity:** HIGH\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Artifacts contain conflicting information\
    *   Downstream problems from unresolved inconsistency\
    *   User confusion about \"what we decided\"\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Surface the contradiction explicitly\
    2.  Stop forward progress until resolved\
    3.  Update all affected artifacts\
    4.  Log resolution as decision\
*   **Prevention:** Never proceed past unresolved contradictions; flag immediately [33]\
\
**F.4.3 TOUCHPOINT 4.3: User Resistance to Process**\
\
**FAILURE: LOST BENEFITS FROM ABANDONMENT**\
*   **Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Process elements skipped at user insistence\
    *   Gaps in documentation/governance\
    *   Problems emerge that process would have prevented\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  When problems emerge, note connection to skipped process [34]\
    2.  Offer to retroactively apply (if salvageable)\
    3.  Use as teaching moment (gently)\
*   **Prevention:** Explain value clearly; offer lightweight alternatives rather than all-or-nothing [35]\
\
**F.4.4 TOUCHPOINT 4.4: Multi-Project Confusion**\
\
**FAILURE: CROSS-CONTAMINATION**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Artifacts mixed between projects\
    *   Decisions applied to wrong project [35]\
    *   Context from one project bleeds into another\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Identify contamination points\
    2.  Separate artifacts\
    3.  Verify each project's integrity\
    4.  Add explicit project identifiers\
*   **Prevention:** Strict project naming; separate chats when possible; explicit project reference [36]\
\
**F.4.5 TOUCHPOINT 4.5: External Stakeholder Information**\
\
**FAILURE: UNVERIFIED DATA INCORPORATED** [36]\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Third-party input treated as verified without checking\
    *   Scope changes from external sources accepted uncritically\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Flag unverified data in artifacts\
    2.  Verify with user before incorporating\
    3.  Note source limitations\
*   **Prevention:** Always mark external input as \"per [source]\"; verify significant items [37]\
\
**F.4.6 TOUCHPOINT 4.6: User Inertia / Passive Acquiescence**\
\
**FAILURE: RUBBER-STAMPING (Error Propagation)**\
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM\
*   **Detection Signals:**\
    *   Repeated minimal acknowledgments: \"ok\", \"k\", \"yes\", \"fine\", \"sure\"\
    *   Three or more such responses in sequence\
    *   Decreasing response length over time\
    *   Responses don't engage with substance presented\
*   **Recovery Path:**\
    1.  Pause forward progress\
    2.  Name the pattern: \"I notice we're moving quickly with brief confirmations\"\
    3.  Offer options:\
        *   \"Would you like to take a brief break?\"\
        *   \"Should I walk through recent content in more detail?\" [38]\
        *   \"Are you confident in what we've covered, or would a summary help?\"\
    4.  If user confirms engagement, proceed with heightened verification\
    5.  If user is fatigued, suggest session break or abbreviated closeout\
    6.  Note pattern in session log if significant\
*   **Prevention:** Calibrate confirmation to stakes; batch lower-stakes confirmations [39]\
\
#### F.5 CROSS-CUTTING FAILURES\
\
Failures that can occur across multiple tou< 2026/02/13 15:36:05.000294157  length=1199 from=41461 to=42659
chpoints.\
