Here is the updated full text of **Appendix H: Quick Start Guide** for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8.\
\
This update incorporates the **Rooting (Phase 0)** formalization and **Phase Protocol** creation steps defined in the v1.0.8 drafting findings and revised sections [1-3]. It integrates the collaborative \"ceremony is continuity\" philosophy [4] into the initiation workflow.\

\
# APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE\
\
**Version:** 2.0 (v1.0.8-DRAFT)\
**Date:** February 2026\
\
## GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
### WHAT IS THIS?\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
---\
\
### BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an **Exploration Session** (see below).\
\
#### READINESS CHECK\
Before initiating a formal project (Rooting), you should be able to answer:\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   If these answers are clear ... Proceed to **\"Rooting Your First Project\"**\
*   If these answers are unclear ... Start with an **Exploration Session**\
\
#### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
1.  Open a new AI chat\
2.  Upload the AI Operations Manual\
3.  Say: *\"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"*\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   *\"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"*\
*   *\"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"*\
*   *\"What would success look like?\"*\
*   *\"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"*\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check so you can enter **Rooting (Phase 0)**.\
\
---\
\
### ROOTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (PHASE 0)\
Every project begins with **Rooting**...the formal Phase 0 where you build the project's nervous system. You will not produce deliverables in this phase; you will produce the governance infrastructure (Project Guide and Phase Protocol) that makes execution possible [1, 2].\
\
**Follow these steps exactly:**\
\
#### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
You need two files:\
*   **GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1.0.8.txt** (the framework)\
*   **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form** (the intake template)\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. Partial or blank forms are normal. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You will develop it through dialog with the AI [5, 6].\
\
#### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
#### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
Send a message like:\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and my TPL-001 [partial/blank]. Let's enter **Rooting (Phase 0)**. Please engage in collaborative project design...probe my assumptions, challenge vague criteria, and help me structure the phases and Phase Protocol before we finalize anything.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
#### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DESIGN\
**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP.** Rooting is design work, not form completion [7].\
\
**What the AI will do:**\
*   Ask clarifying questions about your objective\
*   Surface assumptions you haven't stated\
*   Propose a **Phase Structure** (grouping work into logical stages) [8]\
*   Identify required **AI behaviors** for the work (to feed the Phase Protocol)\
*   Challenge vague success criteria\
\
**What you should do:**\
*   Answer thoughtfully, not quickly.\
*   **Push back** if the AI misunderstands.\
*   **Request alternatives** (\"What if we approached it differently?\").\
*   **Be honest about uncertainty** (\"I don't know yet. Can we leave that open?\").\
\
Expect 10...20 exchanges. If Rooting takes an entire session, that is a good investment [8].\
\
#### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
After sufficient dialog, the AI will generate two foundational documents [8, 9]:\
\
**1. The Project Guide**\
Defines **WHAT** the project is:\
*   Objective, Scope (In/Out), and Constraints\
*   Phase Structure and Timeline\
*   Deliverables and Success Criteria\
\
**2. The Base Phase Protocol**\
Defines **HOW** the AI should behave (Phase-Stable Governance) [10, 11]:\
*   **Layer 1:** Universal AIPM behaviors (initiation, closeout, etc.)\
*   **Layer 2:** Methodology (e.g., research, coding, writing styles)\
*   **Layer 3:** Project-specific context and conventions\
\
**Review these carefully.** They are the project's constitution.\
*   *If the scope is wrong, fix the Project Guide.*\
*   *If the AI's behavior instructions are wrong, fix the Phase Protocol.*\
\
#### STEP 6: CONFIRM ALIGNMENT AND EXIT ROOTING\
When both documents are correct, confirm:\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I'm ready to close Rooting and begin Phase 1.\"\
\
The AI will then:\
1.  Confirm **Rooting Exit Criteria** are met [12, 13]\
2.  Generate the **Bootstrap** for the first execution session\
\
**USER ACTION ... POST-ROOTING SETUP:**\
1.  **Download** the Project Guide, Phase Protocol, and Bootstrap.\
2.  **Store** the Phase Protocol in your Project Knowledge / Context (if supported) or keep it ready for upload.\
3.  **Verify** the Bootstrap includes the mandatory first action: *\"Review Phase Protocol.\"*\
\
---\
\
### WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
After Rooting, you enter **Execution (Phase 1)** using the standard workflows:\
\
#### CONTINUING A PROJECT (Session to Session)\
1.  Upload the **Bootstrap** from your prior session.\
2.  The AI reviews the **Phase Protocol** (mandatory first action) [14, 15].\
3.  The AI generates an **Alignment Checklist** for you to verify [16, 17].\
4.  Onc< 2026/02/13 15:39:02.000150786  length=2543 from=64729 to=67271
e aligned, work begins.\
\
#### RESUMING AFTER A BREAK (Extended Absence)\
1.  Use the **Re-Entry Checklist (TPL-007)**.\
2.  Upload the Project Guide and last Bootstrap to re-orient [18].\
\
#### TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES\
1.  Upload the **Project Guide** and **Roadmap**.\
2.  Execute the **8-Step Phase Transition Protocol** [19, 20].\
3.  **Evaluate the Phase Protocol:** Does AI behavior need to change for the new phase? If yes, redraft it [21, 22].\
\
---\
\
### KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**ROOTING (Phase 0):** The deliberate phase before execution where you build the Project Guide and Phase Protocol. \"If rooting takes 10 sessions, take 10 sessions.\" [8]\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** A phase-stable document that tells the AI *how* to behave (behaviors, methodology, conventions). It persists across sessions within a phase. [10, 11]\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A session-specific handoff file. It tells the AI *where* we left off and what to do next. It changes every session. [14, 23]\
\
**ALIGNMENT TURN:** The mandatory checklist at the start of every session where you verify scope before the AI starts working. \"Propose and pause beats assume and proceed.\" [16, 24]\
\
**SESSION CLOSEOUT:** The user-initiated sequence to end a session cleanly. Produces the Session Log and next Bootstrap. [25, 26]\
\
---\
\
### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **Rushing Rooting:** Jumping into execution before the Phase Protocol is defined. This leads to behavioral drift and constant re-correction.\
2.  **Skipping the Alignment Turn:** Letting the AI start working immediately after bootstrap upload. Always verify the plan first.\
3.  **Silent Scope Expansion:** Letting the project grow without updating the Project Guide.\
4.  **Ignoring the Phase Protocol:** Not storing it in Project Knowledge or failing to ensure the AI reviews it at session start.\
5.  **Treating Phase Transitions as Regular Sessions:** Failing to pause and re-plan when moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2.\
\
### SUMMARY: YOUR FIRST PROJECT IN 6 STEPS\
1.  **GATHER:** Manual + TPL-001 (partial/blank is fine).\
2.  **UPLOAD:** New chat, attach files.\
3.  **INITIATE:** *\"Let's enter Rooting (Phase 0). Help me design this project.\"*\
4.  **ENGAGE:** Discuss scope, phases, and behaviors (15...30 mins).\
5.  **REVIEW:** Approve the Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol.\
6.  **CONFIRM:** Download artifacts, store Phase Protocol, and get the Phase 1 Bootstrap.
