**[1] | Dialog Intake System Description**\
\
Based on Section 3 of the **GOV-AIPM Manual**, the **Dialog Intake System** is defined not as a separate software tool, but as a \"behavioral layer\" that governs how the AI elicits information, routes users to appropriate processes, and synthesizes conversation into structured artifacts [2]. Its primary purpose is to transform the AI from a reactive text generator into an active **intake coordinator** that translates unstructured user descriptions into the framework's formal structures [3].\
\
### **Information Flow: From Intent to Artifact**\
Information flows from the user to the AI through a five-step translation process designed to ensure inputs are actionable and complete [4]:\
\
1.  **Intent Recognition:** The AI must diagnose what the user is trying to accomplish (e.g., distinguishing between \"initiation,\" \"continuation,\" or \"recovery\") rather than just responding to the literal text.\
2.  **Structured Elicitation:** The AI asks specific, sequenced questions to gather the necessary data for a given artifact, rather than waiting for the user to provide it all at once.\
3.  **Gap Detection:** The AI identifies when information is incomplete, contradictory, or insufficient and surfaces these gaps explicitly.\
4.  **Synthesis:** The AI converts conversational input into properly formatted artifacts (e.g., turning a discussion into a Decision Log entry).\
5.  **Failure Recovery:** The AI detects when intake is failing (e.g., user resistance or confusion) and applies specific recovery protocols.\
\
### **Categorization of Intake Types (Touchpoints)**\
The system maps user interactions to **18 distinct touchpoints** organized into four functional categories [5]:\
\
*   **Entry Points (4):** Moments where the user initiates contact and the AI must determine the need (e.g., First Contact/System Initiation, Session Continuation, Re-Entry After Absence, Phase Transition) [6].\
*   **Artifact Creation (6):** Moments where the AI gathers specific data to populate framework documents (e.g., Project Guide Creation, Decision Capture, Bootstrap Generation, Session Log Entry) [7].\
*   **Process Execution (3):** Ongoing processes requiring user input (e.g., Scope Change Detection, Verification/QA, Weekly Review Facilitation) [8].\
*   **Edge Cases (6):** Non-standard situations requiring specialized handling (e.g., Ambiguous Intent, Contradictory Information, User Resistance, Multi-Project Confusion) [9].\
\
### **Explicit Alignment**\
The Dialog Intake System operates under the **Explicit Alignment Principle** (Section 3), which aims to reduce the gap between what the user wants and what the AI assumes [10]. Key concepts include:\
\
*   **The Fifth-Grader Rule:** A requirement to explain context, constraints, and objectives as if the listener has no prior knowledge, ensuring all implicit requirements are made explicit [11].\
*   **Assumption Surfacing:** The AI acts to \"actively surface assumptions rather than allowing silent gap-filling,\" asking users to verify its understanding before proceeding [12].\
*   **Verification Checkpoints:** Mandatory pauses built into the workflow (e.g., \"Before we proceed, let me confirm my understanding...\") to catch misalignment before it compounds [13].\
\
### **Confirmation Protocols**\
To balance governance with efficiency, the system uses a **Confirmation Calibration Framework** (Section 3.5.3) that assigns different \"weights\" of confirmation to different tasks [14]:\
\
*   **Tier 0: Silent Confirmation:** The AI proceeds and logs the action without asking (e.g., routine session loggin< 2026/02/14 14:14:13.000991663  length=679 from=8693 to=9371
g) [15].\
*   **Tier 1: Lightweight Confirmation:** A brief request where a single acknowledgment (\"Yes\" or \"Got it\") is sufficient (e.g., routine decision capture) [15].\
*   **Tier 2: Explicit Confirmation:** The AI provides a summary and requires a substantive response (e.g., scope clarifications, verification findings) [16].\
*   **Tier 3: Stop-and-Verify:** A full stop in the workflow requiring an explicit \"Confirmed\" before proceeding. This is mandatory for high-stakes actions like **Project Initiation**, **Phase Transitions**, and **Scope Changes** [16].
