Based on the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.8-DRAFT** manual and associated drafting documents, the **Canonical Project Artifacts** (Section 5) form the \"external memory\" system that enables AI projects to maintain continuity, coherence, and integrity across multiple sessions.\
\
These artifacts are designed to overcome the \"amnesia\" of AI sessions by externalizing state, logic, and governance. They function as a coherent ecosystem where **\"Ceremony is Continuity\"** [1, 2].\
\
### **1. The Document Stability Spectrum**\
The relationship between the three primary continuity documents is defined by their stability and scope [3-6]. They form a hierarchy from strategic to tactical:\
\
*   **Project Guide (Section 5.1):** *Project-Stable*. Defines **WHAT** the project is (scope, objectives, deliverables). Changes rarely.\
*   **Phase Protocol (Section 5.2):** *Phase-Stable*. Defines **HOW** work should be conducted (behavioral governance, methodology). Changes only at phase transitions.\
*   **Bootstrap (Section 5.5):** *Session-Specific*. Defines **WHERE** the project is right now (current state, next actions). Changes every session.\
\
### **2. Key Artifact Definitions & Relationships**\
\
#### **Project Guide (5.1)**\
The authoritative definition of the project's identity.\
*   **Function:** Strategic authority. It defines the \"North Star\" for all work.\
*   **Relationship:** It informs the **Phase Protocol** (which extracts phase-specific context from it) and is referenced during **Phase Transitions** to verify strategic alignment [7, 8].\
\
#### **Phase Protocol (5.2)**\
The \"behavioral constitution\" for a specific phase [9].\
*   **Function:** Tells the AI how to behave (e.g., \"Use 100% fidelity extraction,\" \"Stop and verify before drafting\"). It contains three layers: **AIPM Behaviors**, **Methodology**, and **Project Context** [10].\
*   **Relationship:**\
    *   **To Project Guide:** Draws its scope boundaries from the Project Guide.\
    *   **To Bootstrap:** The Bootstrap acts as a \"prompt list\" that explicitly instructs the AI to read the Phase Protocol at the start of every session [6]. They are \"cousins\": the Bootstrap provides the *context*, and the Phase Protocol provides the *governance* [11].\
\
#### **Bootstrap File (5.5)**\
The tactical handoff packet [12].\
*   **Function:** Solves the \"blank slate\" problem at session start. It contains **dynamic state** (what happened last session, what to do next) and **stable instructions** (pointers to the Phase Protocol and notebooks) [13].\
*   **Relationship:** Generated at the end of a session (from the **Session Log** context) and uploaded at the start of the next. It triggers the **Alignment Turn**, where the AI confirms it understands the scope before working [14].\
\
#### **Session Log (< 2026/02/13 23:47:23.000999785  length=2319 from=8513 to=10831
5.4)**\
The chronological record of *what happened* [15].\
*   **Function:** Records activities, outputs, and issues. Crucially, it now includes an embedded **Session Fidelity Report (SFR)**, which assesses *how well* the session went (objective achievement, gaps, handoff readiness) [16, 17].\
*   **Relationship:**\
    *   **To Bootstrap:** The SFR section of the log directly feeds the content of the next session's Bootstrap.\
    *   **To Transcript:** It contains the **Response Index Register** [18], allowing users to locate specific content in the raw transcript.\
\
#### **Decision Log (5.3)**\
The chronological record of *choices made* [15].\
*   **Function:** Captures decisions with rationale (\"Why did we choose X over Y?\"). Distinct from the Session Log, which captures activity.\
*   **Relationship:** Prevents decision churn (re-litigating settled issues). High-impact decisions recorded here may trigger updates to the **Project Guide** [8].\
\
#### **Findings Report (5.6)**\
The record of *empirical discoveries* [19].\
*   **Function:** A synthesis document organized by **topic** (not chronology). Used during research or exploration phases to capture observations, evidence, and implications (indexed as **F-##**).\
*   **Relationship:** Findings provide the *evidence* that informs the *choices* recorded in the **Decision Log** [15].\
\
### **3. Other Key Artifacts**\
\
*   **Backlog Register (5.9):** Captures out-of-scope ideas and deferred tasks. It integrates with the **Insight Capture Protocol**...when scope drift is detected, the item is routed here rather than distracting the current session [20, 21].\
*   **Project Closure Report (5.10):** The final synthesis document that validates success criteria, captures lessons learned, and formally closes the project [22].\
\
### **Summary of Data Flow**\
1.  **Rooting (Phase 0)** creates the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol**.\
2.  **Active Work** generates **Findings** (discoveries) and **Decisions** (choices).\
3.  **Session Closeout** produces a **Session Log** (record) and a **Bootstrap** (handoff).\
4.  **Next Session Start** uses the **Bootstrap** to load context and the **Phase Protocol** to load behaviors.
