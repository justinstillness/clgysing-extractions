# GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
================================================================================\
\
## WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an Exploration Session (see below).\
\
### READINESS CHECK\
\
Before initiating a formal project, you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   If these answers are clear ... Proceed to **\"Starting Your First Project (Rooting)\"**\
*   If these answers are unclear ... Start with an **Exploration Session**\
\
### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
\
1.  Open a new AI chat\
2.  Upload the **AI Operations Manual**\
3.  Say: *\"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"*\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   \"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"\
*   \"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"\
*   \"What would success look like?\"\
*   \"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check when you're ready.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (ROOTING / PHASE 0)\
\
Every project begins with **Rooting (Phase 0)**. This is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation...the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol**...before execution begins.\
\
### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
*   **GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual.txt** (the framework)\
*   **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form** (the intake template)\
\
TPL-001 is included in Appendix A. Extract it to a separate file, or use it directly from the manual.\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. Partial or blank forms are normal. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You'll develop it through dialog with the AI.\
\
### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and my TPL-001 [partial/blank].\
>\
> I'd like to conduct the **Rooting (Phase 0)** process. Let's engage in collaborative pro< 2026/02/13 06:19:51.000198147  length=7358 from=18351 to=25708
ject design...probe my assumptions, challenge vague criteria, and help me define the Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol before we finalize anything.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DESIGN\
\
**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP.**\
\
Project initiation is NOT a passive \"fill out form\" exercise. It is a collaborative design session consisting of 10...20 substantive exchanges (typically 15...30 minutes).\
\
**WHAT THE AI WILL DO:**\
The AI will actively probe your project definition:\
*   **Ask clarifying questions** about your objective.\
*   **Surface assumptions** you haven't stated.\
*   **Probe scope boundaries** (\"What is explicitly OUT of scope?\").\
*   **Propose phasing** (\"We could tackle this in two phases: research then drafting.\").\
*   **Identify templates** needed for execution.\
\
**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**\
*   **Answer thoughtfully.** The goal is clarity, not speed.\
*   **Push back** if the AI misunderstands.\
*   **Request alternatives.** \"What if we approached it differently?\"\
*   **Be honest about uncertainty.** \"I don't know yet. Can we leave that open?\"\
\
This dialog builds the governance infrastructure that makes coherent multi-session execution possible.\
\
### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
\
After sufficient dialog, the AI will synthesize your conversation into two foundational documents:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Defines *WHAT* the project is (objectives, scope, constraints, deliverables, phase structure).\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Defines *HOW* the AI should behave (methodology, formatting standards, coordination duties for Phase 1).\
\
Review these carefully. The Project Guide is your strategy; the Phase Protocol is your behavioral governance.\
\
If something is wrong, say so:\
*   *\"The scope section doesn't capture [X]. Let's revise that.\"*\
*   *\"The Phase Protocol needs to emphasize [specific behavior] for this drafting phase.\"*\
\
Iterate until both documents accurately reflect your intent.\
\
### STEP 6: CONFIRM ALIGNMENT AND BEGIN\
\
When the documents are right, confirm:\
\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I'm ready to proceed to Phase 1.\"\
\
The AI will then:\
1.  Finalize the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\
2.  Generate the **Bootstrap** for your first execution session.\
\
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................\
... USER ACTION: Post-Rooting Setup                                     ...\
...                                                                     ...\
... 1. Download all artifacts (Project Guide, Phase Protocol, Bootstrap)...\
... 2. Store the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge                    ...\
... 3. Verify the Bootstrap includes a mandatory first action to        ...\
...    review the Phase Protocol                                        ...\
... 4. Update your new chat notepad with the next session name          ...\
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................\
\
You are now operating within the GOV-AIPM framework.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
\
After your first session, you'll use different workflows:\
\
### CONTINUING A PROJECT (Session to Session)\
*   **Upload:** The **Bootstrap** from your prior session (and any required files).\
*   **AI Action:** The AI reviews the **Phase Protocol** (from Project Knowledge) to align behavior, then reads the Bootstrap to restore context.\
*   **Alignment:** The AI generates an **Alignment Checklist**. You verify it.\
*   **Execute:** Work proceeds.\
\
### RESUMING AFTER A BREAK (Days or Weeks Away)\
*   **Use:** The **Re-Entry Protocol** (TPL-007).\
*   **Action:** Conduct a dedicated reorientation chat to verify context integrity before resuming work.\
\
### TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES\
*   **Use:** The **Phase Transition Protocol** (Section 4.3.5).\
*   **Action:** Pause execution to consolidate work, evaluate the **Phase Protocol** (redraft if behaviors need to change), and plan the upcoming phase.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A handoff document generated at the end of each session. Contains everything needed to resume. Always save it. Always upload it next session.\
\
**PROJECT GUIDE:** The authoritative definition of your project (the \"What\"). Created during Rooting, updated as scope evolves.\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** The behavioral constitution for a phase (the \"How\"). Tells the AI how to behave, format output, and manage tokens. Stored in Project Knowledge.\
\
**SESSION CLOSEOUT:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly...saving files, generating the bootstrap, logging decisions. Non-negotiable.\
\
**DECISION LOG:** Record of significant choices made during the project. Captures what was decided, why, and what alternatives were rejected.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **RUSHING ROOTING:** Skipping the intake dialog to start \"real work.\" Rooting *is* real work...it prevents the misalignment that kills projects later.\
2.  **IGNORING THE PHASE PROTOCOL:** Failing to store it in Project Knowledge or review it at session start. This causes the AI to \"forget\" how to behave.\
3.  **NOT SAVING THE BOOTSTRAP:** Ending a session without a bootstrap means losing context and wasting time reconstructing state.\
4.  **CHERRY-PICKING:** Using some templates but skipping logs or closeouts. The components interlock; gaps create failure modes.\
5.  **SILENT ACCEPTANCE:** Accepting AI output without review. The AI is a junior associate, not an oracle. You remain accountable.\
\
================================================================================\
\
## GETTING HELP\
\
**If you get stuck:**\
*   Upload the manual and ask: *\"I'm having trouble with [X]. What does the framework say about this?\"*\
\
**If something isn't working:**\
*   Check the **Troubleshooting Guide** (Appendix D).\
*   Review the **Failure Mode Catalog** (Appendix F).\
\
================================================================================\
\
## SUMMARY: YOUR FIRST PROJECT IN 6 STEPS\
\
1.  **GATHER:** Manual + TPL-001 (partial or blank is normal).\
2.  **UPLOAD:** New AI chat, attach both files.\
3.  **INITIATE:** *\"I'm starting a new project using GOV-AIPM. Let's conduct the **Rooting (Phase 0)** process to design the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\"*\
4.  **ENGAGE:** 10...20 exchanges of back-and-forth. Answer thoughtfully. Push back.\
5.  **REVIEW:** Check the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol** drafts. Iterate until right.\
6.  **CONFIRM:** *\"This captures my intent. I'm ready to proceed.\"*\
