## GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
### WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
### BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an Exploration Session (see below).\
\
#### READINESS CHECK\
\
Before initiating a formal project (entering Rooting), you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   If these answers are clear ... Proceed to \"Starting Your First Project (Rooting)\"\
*   If these answers are unclear ... Start with an Exploration Session\
\
#### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
\
1.  Open a new AI chat\
2.  Upload the AI Operations Manual\
3.  Say: *\"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"*\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   \"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"\
*   \"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"\
*   \"What would success look like?\"\
*   \"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check when you're ready.\

\
### STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (ROOTING)\
\
In the GOV-AIPM framework, starting a project is called **Rooting** (or Phase 0). It is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation before execution begins.\
\
**Rooting produces two essential outputs:**\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Defines *what* the project is (scope, deliverables, timeline).\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Defines *how* the AI should behave (methodology, rules, format).\
\
Follow these steps exactly.\
\
#### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
*   **GOV-AIPM Manual** (or relevant volume)\
*   **TPL-001 Project Initiation Form** (v2.0)\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. Partial or blank forms are normal. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You will develop it through dialog with the AI.\
\
#### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
#### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and my TPL-001 [partial/blank]. Please initiate the Rooting process (Phase 0). Let's engage in collaborative design to establish the Project Guide and Base Phase Protocol.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
#### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DESIGN\
\
**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP.** Read carefully.\
\
Rooting is not \"fill out form ... AI tells you what to do.\" It is a collaborative design session consisting of 10-20 exchanges of substantive back-and-forth.\
\
**WHAT THE AI WILL DO:**\
The AI will actively probe your project definition:\
*   **Ask clarifying questions** about your objective.\
*   **Surface assumptions** you haven't stated.\
*   **Probe scope boundaries** (\"What is explicitly OUT of scope?\").\
*   **Propose phasing options** (breaking the work into Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).\
*   **Determine methodology** (which feeds Layer 2 of the Phase Protocol).\
\
**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**\
*   **Answer thoughtfully.** The goal is clarity, not speed.\
*   **Push back** if the AI misunderstands (\"No, that's not what I meant.\").\
*   **Raise constraints** (\"We can't use external data sources.\").\
*   **Be honest about uncertainty** (\"I don't know yet. Can we decide later?\").\
\
*If rooting takes multiple sessions, that is fine. This is the nervous system of your project. Do not rush to \"real work\"...this IS the work that makes execution possible.*\
\
#### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
\
After the dialog, the AI will draft two documents for your approval:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Confirm it captures the scope, objectives, and phase structure accurately.\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Confirm it captures the behavioral rules, formatting standards, and methodology you expect the AI to follow.\
\
Iterate until both documents accurately reflect your intent.\
\
#### STEP 6: CONFIRM ALIGNMENT AND BEGIN\
\
When the documents are right, confirm:\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I approve the Project Guide and Phase Protocol. Please generate the Bootstrap for the first execution session.\"\
\
**USER ACTION ... POST-ROOTING SETUP:**\
1.  **Download** the Project Guide, Phase Protocol, and Bootstrap.\
2.  **Store the Phase Protocol** in your Project Knowledge (or a dedicated folder).\
3.  **Upload*< 2026/02/13 02:44:42.000368408  length=3372 from=111421 to=114792
* the transcript to your project notebook (if using NotebookLM).\
4.  **Verify** the Bootstrap includes the mandatory first action to review the Phase Protocol.\
\
You are now ready to begin Phase 1.\
\
---\
\
### WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
\
After your first session, you will use different workflows:\
\
**CONTINUING A PROJECT (Session to Session):**\
*   Start a new chat.\
*   Upload the **Bootstrap** from your prior session.\
*   The AI will review the **Phase Protocol** (from Project Knowledge) and the Bootstrap to reorient.\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.2.\
\
**RESUMING AFTER A BREAK (Days or Weeks Away):**\
*   Use the **Re-Entry Protocol** (TPL-007).\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.3.\
\
**TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES:**\
*   Use the **Phase Transition Protocol** (Section 4.3.5).\
*   You will evaluate and potential redraft the Phase Protocol for the new phase.\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.4.\
\
---\
\
### KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**ROOTING (Phase 0):** The dedicated phase for defining the project before execution begins.\
\
**PROJECT GUIDE:** The strategic definition of *what* the project is (scope, objectives).\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** The behavioral definition of *how* the AI works (rules, format, tone). Stable within a phase.\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A handoff document generated at the end of each session. Contains current state and next actions. **Always save it. Always upload it next session.**\
\
**SESSION CLOSEOUT:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly...saving files, generating bootstrap, logging decisions. Non-negotiable.\
\
**DECISION LOG:** Record of significant choices made during the project.\
\
---\
\
### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **SKIPPING THE INTAKE DIALOG:** Uploading a form and expecting instant output. The dialog is where alignment happens.\
2.  **RUSHING ROOTING:** Trying to start execution before the Phase Protocol is defined. This leads to behavioral drift.\
3.  **NOT SAVING THE BOOTSTRAP:** Ending a session without saving the bootstrap. You will lose context and waste time reconstructing.\
4.  **IGNORING THE PHASE PROTOCOL:** Failing to store it in Project Knowledge, causing the AI to revert to generic behaviors in the next session.\
5.  **TREATING AI OUTPUT AS FINAL:** Accepting what the AI produces without review. AI is a capable assistant, not an oracle. You remain accountable.\
\
---\
\
### GETTING HELP\
\
**If you get stuck:**\
*   Upload the manual and ask: *\"I'm having trouble with [X]. What does the framework say about this?\"*\
\
**If something isn't working:**\
*   Check the **Troubleshooting Guide** (Manual Appendix D).\
*   Review the **Failure Mode Catalog** (Manual Appendix F).\
\

\
### SUMMARY: YOUR FIRST PROJECT IN 6 STEPS\
\
1.  **GATHER FILES:** Manual + TPL-001 (partial/blank is normal).\
2.  **UPLOAD:** New AI chat, attach both files.\
3.  **INITIATE:** *\"I'm starting a new project. Initiate Rooting (Phase 0). Let's design the Project Guide and Phase Protocol collaboratively.\"*\
4.  **ENGAGE:** 10-20 exchanges of back-and-forth. Answer thoughtfully. Push back.\
5.  **REVIEW:** Check the Project Guide and Phase Protocol drafts. Iterate until right.\
