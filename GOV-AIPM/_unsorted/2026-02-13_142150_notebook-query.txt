Based on the sources provided, specifically the v1.0.7 baseline manual and the v1.0.8 drafting documents, here is the status of the version entries in Appendix E:

**There is no v1.0.7 entry in Appendix E.**

In the **GOV-AIPM v1.0.7-DRAFT** manual, Appendix E (Version History) lists the following entries:
*   **v1.0.0** (Initial Release) [1]
*   **v1.0.3** (December 26, 2025) - Added Dialog Intake System and Appendix F [2]
*   **v1.0.6** (December 28, 2025) - Cross-reference audit and corrections [3]

The text immediately following the v1.0.6 entry reads: `[FUTURE ENTRIES WILL BE APPENDED BELOW]` [4].

However, the **v1.0.7 changes** are documented in the **"Revisions Integrated During Assembly"** section at the very end of the manual, rather than in Appendix E itself. These changes (dated December 28, 2025, Session 030) included:
*   New Section 4.3.5.2.1 (Token Considerations for Phase Transitions)
*   New Appendix H (Quick Start Guide) [5, 6]

**Drafting Status for v1.0.8:**
The drafting plan for **v1.0.8** explicitly includes an action to "Appendix E: Version History (add v1.0.8 entry)" [7, 8], but it does not mention retroactively adding a v1.0.7 entry to the appendix table.
