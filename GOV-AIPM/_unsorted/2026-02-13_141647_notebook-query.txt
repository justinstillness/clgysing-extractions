Here is the complete full text of **Appendix D: Troubleshooting Guide** from the GOV-AIPM manual.\
\
***\
\
**APPENDIX D: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**\
\
This appendix provides problem-to-solution guidance for common issues encountered in AI-assisted work. Use this guide when something isn't working as expected before escalating to more intensive recovery protocols.\
\
**Organization:** Problems are grouped by category. Each entry includes symptoms, likely causes, and recommended solutions. Cross-references to relevant manual sections and templates are provided for deeper guidance. [1]\
\
### HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE\
\
1. Identify the category that best matches your issue\
2. Find the specific problem description\
3. Verify symptoms match your situation\
4. Apply the recommended solution\
5. If unresolved, escalate per the guidance provided\
\
**Severity Indicators:**\
- **QUICK FIX:** Resolvable in minutes with simple action\
- **MODERATE:** Requires deliberate effort, possibly 15-30 minutes\
- **INVOLVED:** May require significant time or new session\
- **ESCALATE:** Use formal recovery protocol (TPL-009) [2], [3]\
\
---\
\
### D.1 SESSION MANAGEMENT ISSUES\
\
**PROBLEM: AI seems to have forgotten earlier context**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- AI contradicts earlier decisions\
- Asks for information already provided\
- \"I don't recall\" or generic responses to specific queries\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Token limit exceeded (context window full)\
- New session started without bootstrap\
- Information was in a different chat branch\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Remind and re-orient:**\
\"Refer to the Project Guide section on [topic]. We decided [X]. Please confirm understanding before we proceed.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Bootstrap and restart:**\
If context loss is severe, generate a bootstrap (TPL-002) capturing current state and continue in a fresh chat.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 6 (Session Lifecycle), TPL-002 (Bootstrap) [3], [4]\
\
**PROBLEM: AI responses are becoming slow or degraded**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Longer response times\
- Incomplete responses\
- Responses cut off mid-sentence\
- Declining response quality\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Token limit approaching\
- Complex context accumulation\
- Platform performance issues\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Check token status:**\
Ask: \"Approximately how much of your context window have we used?\" (Note: AI estimates may be rough but directionally useful)\
\
**[MODERATE] Reduce active context:**\
\"Let's focus narrowly on [specific task]. You don't need to reference [earlier topics] for this.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Emergency bootstrap:**\
Generate bootstrap immediately, save all files, continue in new chat. See Section 14.4 (Token Collapse) for detailed protocol.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 6.4 (Token Management), Section 14.4 (Token Collapse) [4], [5], [6]\
\
**PROBLEM: Session ended unexpectedly without closeout**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Chat closed without generating artifacts\
- No bootstrap created\
- No session log\
- Work potentially lost\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Token exhaustion\
- Platform timeout\
- User error (closed tab)\
- Browser/app crash\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[MODERATE] Recover from chat history:**\
1. Access chat history/transcript if available\
2. Export using Claude Exporter if chat is still accessible\
3. Manually reconstruct key outputs from transcript\
\
**[INVOLVED] Reconstruct from memory:**\
1. Document what you remember immediately\
2. List decisions made (mark as [RECONSTRUCTED])\
3. Note uncertainties explicitly\
4. Create reconstruction log for audit trail\
\
**[ESCALATE] If significant work lost:**\
Use TPL-009 (Failure Recovery Worksheet), Protocol D (Token Collapse)\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 14.4 (Token Collapse), TPL-009 [6], [7], [8]\
\
**PROBLEM: Bootstrap didn't transfer context effectively**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- New session AI seems confused\
- AI asks questions answered in bootstrap\
- Work direction doesn't match expectations\
- AI makes different assumptions than previous session\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Bootstrap too compressed\
- Key context omitted\
- Ambiguous language in bootstrap\
- AI interpretation differs\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Clarify specific points:**\
\"The bootstrap mentioned [X]. To clarify: [explicit clarification]. Please confirm understanding.\"\
\
**[MO< 2026/02/13 14:19:00.000138559  length=8192 from=25077 to=33268
DERATE] Supplement bootstrap:**\
Provide additional context files referenced in bootstrap. Ask: \"What questions do you have about the bootstrap before we proceed?\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Conduct alignment check:**\
\"Based on the bootstrap, please summarize: (1) project objective, (2) current state, (3) immediate next actions, (4) key constraints.\"\
Correct any misalignments before proceeding.\
\
**PREVENTION:** Use \"Questions to Address at Session Start\" section in bootstrap.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 6.3 (Bootstrap Protocol), TPL-002 [8], [9], [10]\
\
---\
\
### D.2 ALIGNMENT ISSUES\
\
**PROBLEM: AI is \"drifting\" from the objective**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Output becomes increasingly tangential\
- Focus shifts to minor details\
- Tone changes inappropriate to task\
- Ignoring stated constraints\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Context dilution\
- Ambiguous prompt chain\
- AI \"creative license\" unchecked\
- User implicitly encouraged drift\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Stop and anchor:**\
\"Stop. We are drifting from the primary objective: [Objective]. Abandon the current line of thought and return to [Topic].\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Restate constraints:**\
\"Review the Project Guide parameters for this deliverable. You are violating Constraint [X]. Align future outputs with this constraint.\"\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 3 (Explicit Alignment), Section 14.3 (Cognitive Divergence) [10]\
\
**PROBLEM: AI misunderstands the core task (Cognitive Divergence)**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- AI confidently produces wrong work\
- Corrections don't stick\
- Logic seems internally consistent but externally wrong\
- \"Yes, but...\" responses that miss the point\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Fundamental ambiguity in root prompt\
- Hidden assumption by AI\
- Misinterpretation of a key term\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Direct query:**\
\"I suspect we are misaligned. Please state your understanding of what I'm asking for?\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Surface assumptions:**\
\"Before your next attempt, list the assumptions you're making about: (1) what I want, (2) the format, (3) the constraints.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Use QA-001 (Cognitive Divergence Audit):**\
If Three-Strike threshold reached (3 failed corrections), deploy the formal divergence audit prompt from Appendix B.\
\
**[ESCALATE] If divergence persists:**\
Use TPL-009 (Failure Recovery Worksheet), Protocol G (Cognitive Divergence)\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 14.7 (Cognitive Divergence), QA-001 prompt [11]\
\
**PROBLEM: AI outputs are inconsistent with prior work**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- New outputs contradict earlier outputs\
- Terminology changes without reason\
- Style/tone inconsistent\
- Decisions seem to be re-made differently\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Context not carried forward\
- Decision log not referenced\
- Multiple sessions without continuity\
- AI doesn't have access to prior work\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Provide prior work as reference:**\
\"Here is the previous output: [paste or attach]. Ensure consistency with this in your new output.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Reference decision log:**\
\"Per Decision #[X], we established [decision]. Ensure your output aligns with this.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Conduct consistency audit:**\
Upload both outputs to a validation AI. Ask: \"Compare these two outputs. Identify inconsistencies in terminology, approach, or conclusions.\"\
\
**PREVENTION:** Maintain decision log, reference it in bootstraps, provide prior deliverables to new sessions.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 5.2 (Decision Logs), TPL-004 [12], [13], [14]\
\
---\
\
### D.3 OUTPUT QUALITY ISSUES\
\
**PROBLEM: AI output contains obvious errors or hallucinations**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Factually incorrect statements\
- Made-up references or citations\
- Confident claims that feel wrong\
- Internal contradictions in output\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- AI hallucination (generating plausible but false content)\
- Training data errors\
- Extrapolation beyond knowledge\
- No verification performed\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Direct correction:**\
\"This statement is incorrect: [quote]. The correct information is [X]. Please revise.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Request source verification:**\
\"For each factual claim in this output, indicate your confidence level and whether I should verify independently.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Cross-AI validation:**\
Submit output to different AI platform using VERIF-001 prompt for independent review.\
\
**[ESCALATE] If pattern persists:**\
Use TPL-009, Protocol C (Unchecked AI Assumptions)\
\
**PREVENTION:** Apply Tier 2 validation for important deliverables. Maintain skepticism on factual claims.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 13.1 (Hallucination Risks), Section 11.2 (QA Tiers) [14], [15], [16]\
\
**PROBLEM: Output is too generic / not specific enough**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Boilerplate language\
- Lacks project-specific detail\
- Could apply to anything\
- Missing concrete examples\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Insufficient context provided\
- Instructions too vague\
- AI defaulting to safe/general responses\
- No examples to anchor on\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Request specificity:**\
\"This is too generic. Revise to include: [specific elements]. Reference [specific context].\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Provide examples:**\
\"Here's an example of the specificity I need: [example]. Match this level of detail.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Add constraints:**\
\"Include at least [N] specific examples. Reference [specific documents]. Use [specific terminology].\"\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 5 (Alignment Principles) [17], [18]\
\
**PROBLEM: Output is too long / verbose**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Excessive length\
- Repetitive content\
- Padding with unnecessary detail\
- Buries key points in verbiage\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- No length constraint specified\
- AI defaulting to comprehensive\
- Mistaking thoroughness for quality\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Request compression:**\
\"Reduce this by 50%. Keep only essential content. Remove redundancy.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Specify constraints upfront:**\
\"Maximum [N] words/paragraphs. Prioritize [key elements]. Omit [unnecessary elements].\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Request executive summary:**\
\"Provide a 3-sentence summary first, then the full content. I may only need the summary.\"\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 5.3 (Clear Communication) [18], [19], [20]\
\
**PROBLEM: Output doesn't match requested format**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Wrong structure\
- Missing required sections\
- Format inconsistent with examples\
- Ignores template specifications\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Format instructions unclear\
- Template not provided\
- AI substituted own judgment\
- Instructions buried in long prompt\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Restate format requirement:**\
\"The format must be: [explicit structure]. Revise to match exactly.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Provide template:**\
\"Use this exact template: [template]. Fill in each section as specified.\"\
\
**[MODERATE] Break into steps:**\
\"First, create the outline matching [structure]. Show me the outline. Then I'll confirm before you draft content.\"\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 5.2 (Constraint Communication) [20], [21]\
\
---\
\
### D.4 PROCESS ISSUES\
\
**PROBLEM: Decisions keep getting re-debated**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Same issues discussed repeatedly\
- Contradictory decisions in different sessions\
- Feeling of \"didn't we already decide this?\"\
- Progress stalls on settled issues\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- No decision log maintained\
- Decision log not referenced\
- Decisions not communicated to new sessions\
- Rationale not documented\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[MODERATE] Establish decision as settled:**\
\"This was decided in Decision #[X]: [decision]. The rationale was [Y]. This is not open for re-debate. Proceed accordingly.\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Reconstruct decision history:**\
Review chat transcripts to identify decisions made. Document with [RECONSTRUCTED] tag. Create decision log going forward.\
\
**[ESCALATE] If pattern systematic:**\
Use TPL-009, Protocol A (No Logs ... Decision Churn)\
\
**PREVENTION:** Maintain decision log from project start. Include key decisions in every bootstrap. Reference decision numbers when relevant.\

*CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 5.2 (Decision Logs), Section 14.1 (Decision Churn) [22], [23], [24]\
\
**PROBLEM: Actual practice has drifted from documented process**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Doing things differently than SOP specifies\
- Can't remember last time you followed the process\
- Documentation feels outdated\
- New habits developed without documentation\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Process evolved through practice\
- Documentation not updated\
- Workarounds became standard\
- Process was impractical as designed\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[MODERATE] Conduct SOP audit:**\
Compare documented procedure to actual practice. List specific divergences.\
\
**[INVOLVED] Determine resolution:**\
For each divergence, decide:\
- Update SOP to match reality (practice is better)\
- Retrain to match SOP (procedure is better)\
- Hybrid approach\
\
**[INVOLVED] Update documentation:**\
Document the resolution. Update SOP. Communicate changes.\
\
**[ESCALATE] If drift is significant:**\
Use TPL-009, Protocol B (SOP Drift)\
\
**PREVENTION:** Include process check in weekly review (TPL-006). Update documentation when practices change.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 14.2 (SOP Drift), TPL-006 (Weekly Review) [24], [25], [26]\
\
**PROBLEM: Returning to project after absence - feeling lost**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Can't remember where you left off\
- Context feels stale\
- Unsure what's been decided\
- Risk of contradicting prior work\
\
**LIKELY CAUSES:**\
- Extended time away from project\
- Context decay (normal human memory)\
- No re-entry protocol followed\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[MODERATE] Abbreviated re-entry (1-2 weeks away):**\
1. Review last session log\
2. Review last bootstrap\
3. Scan recent decisions\
4. Quick reorientation prompt to AI\
5. Resume\
\
**[INVOLVED] Full re-entry (2+ weeks away):**\
Use TPL-007 (Re-Entry Checklist) completely. Conduct dedicated reorientation chat before resuming work.\
\
**[ESCALATE] If already produced contradictory work:**\
Use TPL-009, Protocol F (No Re-Entry ... Regression)\
\
**PREVENTION:** Always create bootstrap at session end. Follow re-entry protocol after any significant absence.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 9 (Re-Entry Protocol), TPL-007 [26], [27], [28]\

\
### D.5 TOOL ISSUES\
\
**PROBLEM: Claude Exporter not capturing chat properly**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Export is incomplete\
- Formatting is broken\
- Images/files not included\
- Export fails entirely\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Try different format:**\
If MD fails, try TXT. If TXT fails, try PDF.\
\
**[MODERATE] Manual backup:**\
Select all chat content manually, paste into document. Less elegant but preserves content.\
\
**[MODERATE] Check extension status:**\
Verify Claude Exporter is enabled and updated. Try disabling/re-enabling extension.\
\
**[INVOLVED] Export in sections:**\
For very long chats, export may fail. Try scrolling to load all content first, or accept partial export and note gaps.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Appendix C.3 (Chat Archive Configuration) [29], [30]\
\
**PROBLEM: NotebookLM not finding relevant content**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Queries return irrelevant results\
- Known content not surfaced\
- \"I couldn't find information about that\" responses\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Rephrase query:**\
Try different terminology. Use exact phrases from documents.\
\
**[MODERATE] Check document upload:**\
Verify all relevant documents are uploaded to the notebook. Check that documents processed successfully.\
\
**[MODERATE] Query more specifically:**\
Instead of broad queries, ask about specific sections or documents. \"What does the Project Guide say about [X]?\"\
\
**[INVOLVED] Rebuild notebook:**\
If persistent issues, create fresh notebook and re-upload documents.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Appendix C.2 (NotebookLM Configuration) [30], [31], [32]\
\
**PROBLEM: Files not syncing or organizing properly**\
\
**SYMPTOMS:**\
- Files missing from expected locations\
- Sync conflicts\
- Duplicate files\
- Folder structure inconsistent\
\
**SOLUTIONS:**\
\
**[QUICK FIX] Manual verification:**\
Check cloud storage directly (web interface) to verify actual state.\
\
**[MODERATE] Force sync:**\
Trigger manual sync. Check sync client status. Resolve any conflicts by choosing correct version.\
\
**[MODERATE] Clean up duplicates:**\
Identify authoritative version. Remove or archive duplicates. Document resolution in session log.\
\
**[INVOLVED] Audit folder structure:**\
Compare actual structure to documented convention. Reorganize if necessary. Update any broken references.\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Appendix C.4 (File Organization) [32], [33]\
\

\
### D.6 ESCALATION GUIDE\
\
When troubleshooting steps don't resolve the issue, escalate using the appropriate protocol.\
\
**WHEN TO ESCALATE:**\
\
**ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY if:**\
- Work quality is actively degrading\
- Decisions are being made on faulty basis\
- Significant rework may be required\
- Pattern is systematic, not isolated\
\
**ESCALATE AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING if:**\
- Quick fixes and moderate solutions haven't worked\
- Issue has recurred multiple times\
- Root cause is unclear\
- Process gap may exist [34], [35]\
\
**ESCALATION PATHS:**\
\
| Issue Type | Escalation Protocol | Template |\
|------------|---------------------|----------|\
| Decision churn | Protocol A | TPL-009 |\
| SOP drift | Protocol B | TPL-009 |\
| AI assumptions | Protocol C | TPL-009 |\
| Token collapse | Protocol D | TPL-009 |\
| Cognitive fatigue | Protocol E | TPL-009 |\
| Post-absence regression | Protocol F | TPL-009 |\
| Cognitive divergence | Protocol G | TPL-009 | [35], [36]\
\
**POST-ESCALATION:**\
\
After using TPL-009 (Failure Recovery Worksheet):\
1. Complete the full worksheet including lessons learned\
2. Identify prevention measures\
3. Update documentation if process gaps identified\
4. Note in weekly review (TPL-006) for pattern tracking\
5. Consider whether manual updates needed\
\
**CROSS-REFERENCE:** Section 14 (Failure Modes), TPL-009 [36], [37]\
