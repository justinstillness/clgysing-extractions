Here is the complete full text of the updated **Appendix H: Quick Start Guide** for GOV-AIPM v1.0.8.\
\
This text integrates the **Rooting (Phase 0)** and **Phase Protocol** concepts established in the v1.0.8 draft findings [1, 2] and drafting sections [3, 4], applied to the structure of the original v1.0.7 guide [5].\

# APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE\
\
**Version:** 1.0.8-DRAFT\
**Date:** February 2026\
\
## WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
---\
\
## BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an **Exploration Session** (see below).\
\
### READINESS CHECK\
\
Before initiating a formal project, you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   If these answers are clear ... Proceed to **Starting Your First Project (Rooting)**.\
*   If these answers are unclear ... Start with an **Exploration Session**.\
\
### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
1.  Open a new AI chat.\
2.  Upload the AI Operations Manual.\
3.  Say: *\"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"*\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   \"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"\
*   \"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"\
*   \"What would success look like?\"\
*   \"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check when you're ready.\
\
---\
\
## STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (ROOTING / PHASE 0)\
\
Every new project begins with **Rooting** (Phase 0). This is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation...the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol**...before execution begins [1, 2].\
\
### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
*   `GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1.0.8.txt` (the framework)\
*   `TPL-001 Project Initiation Form` (the intake template)\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do **NOT** need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. In fact, partial or blank forms are the norm. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You'll develop it through collaborative dialog with the AI [6].\
\
### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
### STEP 3: INITIATE THE ROOTING DIALOG\
\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and my TPL-001 [partial/blank]. Let's engage in the Phase 0 rooting process...probe my assumptions, challenge vague criteria, and help me think through scope before we finalize anything.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DESIGN\
\
**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP.**\
\
Rooting is design work, not form completion [7]. Expect 10...20 substantive exchanges where the AI probes your thinking. If rooting takes multiple sessions, take multiple sessions...this is the nervous system of your project [2].\
\
**WHAT THE AI WILL DO:**\
*   **Ask clarifying questions** (\"When you say 'improve,' what specific outcome are you targeting?\")\
*   **Surface assumptions** (\"Are there other stakeholders whose needs should shape this?\")\
*   **Probe scope boundaries** (\"What is explicitly OUT of scope?\")\
*   **Propose phasing** (\"We could tackle this in two phases: research then drafting.\")\
*   **Identify methodology** (\"Does this require a specific research framework or coding standard?\")\
\
**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**\
*   Answer thoughtfully, not quickly.\
*   Push back if the AI misunderstands.\
*   Request alternatives (\"What if we approached it differently?\").\
*   Be honest about uncertainty (\"I don't know yet. Can we leave that open?\").\
\
### STEP 5: REVIEW THE FOUNDATIONAL ARTIFACTS\
\
After sufficient dialog, the AI will synthesize your conversation into two foundational documents [8]:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Defines what the project is (objectives, scope, constraints, success criteria).\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Defines how the AI should behave (methodology, formatting standards, coordination duties).\
\
Review these carefully. The Project Guide is your strategy; the Phase Protocol is your governance.\
\
If something is wrong, say so: *\"The scope section misses [X]\"* or *\"The Phase Protocol needs stricter formatting rules for the output.\"* Iterate until right.\
\
### STEP 6: CONFIRM ALIGNMENT AND BEGIN\
\
When the documents are correct, confirm:\
\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I'm ready to proceed to Phase 1.\"\
\
The AI will then:\
*   Generate the **Bootstrap** for the first execution session.\
*   Confirm the immediate next actions.\
\
**USER ACTION:**\
1.  Download the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol**.\
2.  Store the Phase Protocol in your **Project Knowledge** (or equivalent persistent storage).\
3.  Download the **Bootstrap** to use for your next session [9].\
\
---\
\
## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
\
After your rooting session, you'll use different workflows:\
\
### CONTINUING A PROJECT (Session to Session)\
*   **Upload:** The **Bootstrap** from your prior session.\
*   **Action:** The AI reviews the **Phase Protocol** (from Project Knowledge), acknowledges the Bootstrap, and performs an **Alignment Turn** to confirm scope [10].\
*   **Result:** You verify alignment, and work proceeds.\
\
### RESUMING AFTER A BREAK (Days or Weeks Away)\
*   **Upload:** The **Re-Entry Checklist (TPL-007)**, Project Guide, and last Bootstrap.\
*   **Action:** The AI re-orients to the full project context, not just the last session.\
\
### TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES\
*   **Upload:** Project Guide, Roadmap, and final Bootstrap of the prior phase.\
*   **Action:** The AI evaluates the **Phase Protocol** (does behavior need to change?), updates the **Pro< 2026/02/13 17:32:46.000751085  length=2014 from=16885 to=18898
ject Roadmap**, and plans the upcoming phase (Phase Execution Brief) [11].\
\
---\
\
## KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A handoff document generated at the end of *every* session. Contains everything needed to resume. Always save it. Always upload it next session [12].\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** The \"constitution\" for AI behavior. Tells the AI *how* to act (format, style, rules). Stable within a phase; reviewed at phase transitions [13].\
\
**PROJECT GUIDE:** The authoritative definition of your project. Tells the AI *what* we are building [14].\
\
**ROOTING (PHASE 0):** The mandatory first phase of every project. Establishes the Project Guide and Phase Protocol before execution begins [1].\
\
**SESSION CLOSEOUT:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly...saving files, generating bootstrap, logging decisions. Non-negotiable [15].\
\
---\
\
## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **RUSHING ROOTING:** Skipping the design dialog to \"start real work.\" Rooting *is* real work; it builds the infrastructure for success [16].\
2.  **SKIPPING THE BOOTSTRAP:** Ending a session without saving the bootstrap. You will lose context and waste time reconstructing [17].\
3.  **IGNORING THE PHASE PROTOCOL:** Failing to store the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge, causing the AI to revert to generic behaviors [18].\
4.  **SILENT SCOPE CREEP:** allowing the project to expand without updating the Project Guide. If scope changes, update the Guide [19].\
\
---\
\
## SUMMARY: YOUR FIRST PROJECT IN 6 STEPS\
\
1.  **GATHER:** Manual + TPL-001 (blank is fine).\
2.  **UPLOAD:** New AI chat, attach files.\
3.  **INITIATE:** \"I'm starting a new project. Let's do Phase 0 rooting.\"\
4.  **ENGAGE:** 15...30 minutes of design dialog. Answer questions. Refine scope.\
5.  **REVIEW:** Check the Project Guide and Phase Protocol drafts.\
6.  **CONFIRM:** \"Ready to proceed.\" Download your artifacts.
