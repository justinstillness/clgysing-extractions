**APPENDIX H: QUICK START GUIDE**\
\
**Version:** 1.1 (v1.0.8-DRAFT)\
**Date:** February 2026\
\
This appendix contains the complete Quick Start Guide, also available as a standalone document for distribution. New users should begin here before engaging the full manual.\

# GOV-AIPM QUICK START GUIDE\
\
## WHAT IS THIS?\
\
The AI Operations Manual is a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted project management. It enables structured collaboration between you and AI across multi-session projects while maintaining quality, continuity, and governance.\
\
This Quick Start Guide gets you from \"I just downloaded this\" to \"I'm working on my first project\" in about 30 minutes.\
\
---\
\
## BEFORE YOU BEGIN: ARE YOU READY?\
\
Not every task needs this framework. Quick questions, single-session tasks, and casual exploration work fine without it. Use GOV-AIPM when:\
\
*   Your work will span multiple AI sessions\
*   You need to maintain continuity across days or weeks\
*   Quality and accuracy matter (business, legal, technical work)\
*   You want structured decision tracking\
*   Multiple deliverables or phases are involved\
\
If you're unsure, that's fine...start with an Exploration Session (see below).\
\
### READINESS CHECK\
\
Before initiating a formal project, you should be able to answer:\
\
1.  **What am I trying to produce?** (State in one sentence)\
2.  **Who will use or receive the output?**\
3.  **How will I know when it's done?**\
4.  **Do I have the inputs I need, or know how to get them?**\
5.  **Is this one project or several?**\
\
*   If these answers are clear ... Proceed to \"Starting Your First Project\"\
*   If these answers are unclear ... Start with an Exploration Session\
\
### EXPLORATION SESSIONS (When You're Not Ready Yet)\
\
Some ideas need development before structured execution. An Exploration Session uses AI to clarify your thinking.\
\
**To run an Exploration Session:**\
\
1.  Open a new AI chat\
2.  Upload the AI Operations Manual\
3.  Say: \"I have an idea I'd like to explore before committing to a formal project. Help me think through [describe your idea].\"\
\
**Useful exploration prompts:**\
*   \"What questions should I be able to answer before starting this?\"\
*   \"What are the components of this? Which should I tackle first?\"\
*   \"What would success look like?\"\
*   \"What am I assuming that might not be true?\"\
\
Exploration sessions are low-stakes. Their output helps you complete the Readiness Check when you're ready.\
\

\
## STARTING YOUR FIRST PROJECT (ROOTING / PHASE 0)\
\
Every project begins with **Rooting (Phase 0)**. This is the deliberate process of establishing the project's foundation...its definitions and its behavioral governance...before execution begins.\
\
### STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES\
\
You need two files:\
*   `GOV-AIPM_Complete_Manual_v1.0.8.txt` (the framework)\
*   `TPL-001 Project Initiation Form` (the intake template)\
\
TPL-001 is included in Appendix A. Extract it to a separate file, or use it directly from the manual.\
\
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to complete TPL-001 before uploading. Partial or blank forms are normal. The form is a conversation starter, not a prerequisite. You will develop it through dialog with the AI.\
\
### STEP 2: OPEN A NEW AI CHAT AND UPLOAD\
\
Start a fresh AI chat session. Upload both files.\
\
### STEP 3: INITIATE THE INTAKE DIALOG\
\
Send a message like:\
\
> \"I'm starting a new project using the GOV-AIPM framework. I've uploaded the manual and my TPL-001 [partial/blank]. Per Section 1.4.6.1, let's engage in collaborative rooting (Phase 0)...I expect you to probe my assumptions, challenge vague criteria, and help me think through scope before we finalize the Project Guide and Phase Protocol.\"\
\
Then **STOP**. Wait for the AI to respond.\
\
### STEP 4: ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DESIGN\
\
**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP.**\
\
Rooting is not passive. It is a collaborative design session consisting of 10...20 exchanges (typically 15...30 minutes).\
\
**WHAT THE AI WILL DO:**\
The AI will actively probe your project definition:\
*   **Ask clarifying questions** about your objective\
*   **Surface assumptions** you haven't stated\
*   **Probe scope boundaries** (\"What is explicitly OUT of scope?\")\
*   **Propose phasing options** (\"Should we tackle research first, then drafting?\")\
*   **Challenge vague success criteria** (\"'Make it better' is hard to verify. What does 'better' look like?\")\
\
**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**\
*   **Answer thoughtfully.** The goal is clarity, not speed.\
*   **Push back.** If the AI misunderstands, correct it immediately.\
*   **Raise constraints.** \"Actually, I can't use external data sources.\"\
*   **Be honest about uncertainty.** \"I don't know yet. Can we leave that open?\"\
\
### STEP 5: REVIEW THE ROOTING OUTPUTS\
\
After sufficient dialog, the AI will synthesize your conversation into two foundational documents:\
\
1.  **The Project Guide:** Defines *what* the project is (scope, objectives, constraints, phase structure, success criteria).\
2.  **The Base Phase Protocol:** Defines *how* the AI should behave (methodology, formatting standards, coordinator duties, specific constraints).\
\
Review these carefully.\
*   The **Project Guide** is your strategic map.\
*   The **Phase Protocol** is your behavioral constitution.\
\
If something is wrong, say so: \"The Phase Protocol implies we're doing academic research, but this is a business memo. Adjust the tone requirements.\"\
\
Iterate until both documents accurately reflect your intent.\
\
### STEP 6: CONFIRM ALIGNMENT AND BEGIN\
\
When the documents are right, confirm:\
\
> \"These documents capture my intent. I'm ready to proceed.\"\
\
The AI will then:\
*   Generate the **Bootstrap** for the first execution session.\
*   Confirm the first phase objectives.\
*   Start substantive work.\
\
You are now operating within the GOV-AIPM framework.\
\
---\
\
## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\
\
After your rooting session, you will use different workflows:\
\
**USER ACTION: POST-ROOTING SETUP**\
1.  Download the **Project Guide**, **Phase Protocol**, and **Bootstrap**.\
2.  **Store the Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge.** This allows every future session to access behavioral governance without re-uploading.\
3.  Update your new chat notepad with the next session name.\

NG A PROJECT (Session to Session):**\
*   Upload the **Bootstrap** from your prior session.\
*   The Bootstrap will instruct the AI to review the **Phase Protocol** from Project Knowledge.\
*   The AI will confirm alignment and continue where you left off.\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.2.\
\
**RESUMING AFTER A BREAK:**\
*   Use the **Re-Entry Protocol** (TPL-007).\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.3.\
\
**TRANSITIONING BETWEEN PHASES:**\
*   Use the **Phase Transition Protocol** (Section 4.3.5).\
*   Evaluate whether the Phase Protocol needs redrafting for the new phase.\
*   See Manual Section 1.4.6.4.\
\
---\
\
## KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND\
\
**ROOTING (PHASE 0):** The mandatory first phase of every project. It establishes the Project Guide and Phase Protocol before execution begins.\
\
**PHASE PROTOCOL:** A phase-stable governance document stored in Project Knowledge. It tells the AI *how* to behave (methodology, tone, constraints).\
\
**BOOTSTRAP:** A handoff document generated at the end of each session. It tells the AI *where* you left off (state, next actions).\
\
**PROJECT GUIDE:** The authoritative definition of your project's scope and objectives.\
\
**SESSION CLOSEOUT:** The discipline of ending sessions cleanly...saving files, generating a bootstrap, logging decisions. Non-negotiable.\
\
---\
\
## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\
\
1.  **RUSHING ROOTING:** Skipping the dialog to \"start real work.\" Rooting *is* real work...it builds the nervous system of your project.\
2.  **IGNORING THE PHASE PROTOCOL:** Failing to store it in Project Knowledge, forcing you to re-explain behavioral rules every session.\
3.  **NOT SAVING THE BOOTSTRAP:** Ending a session without a bootstrap means losing your place.\
4.  **CHERRY-PICKING:** Skipping logs or checklists. The components interlock; gaps surface later as confusion.\
5.  **TREATING AI AS ORACLE:** Accepting output without review. You remain accountable.\
\
---\
\
## GETTING HELP\
\
**If you get stuck:**\
*   Upload the manual and ask: \"I'm having trouble with [X]. What does the framework say about this?\"\
\
**If something isn't working:**\
*   Check the **Troubleshooting Guide** (Appendix D)\
*   Review the **Failure Mode Catalog** (Appendix F)\
\
---\
\
## SUMMARY: YOUR FIRST PROJECT IN 6 STEPS\
\
1.  **GATHER:** Manual + TPL-001 (partial/blank is fine).\
2.  **UPLOAD:** New AI chat, attach both files.\
3.  **INITIATE:** \"I'm starting a new project. Per Section 1.4.6.1, let's engage in collaborative rooting (Phase 0).\"\
4.  **ENGAGE:** 10...20 exchanges. Answer thoughtfully. Push back.\
5.  **REVIEW:** Check the **Project Guide** and **Phase Protocol** drafts.\
6.  **CONFIRM:** \"Ready to proceed.\" Download artifacts. Store Phase Protocol in Project Knowledge.
